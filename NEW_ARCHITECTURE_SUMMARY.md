# New Multi-Socket Architecture Implementation Summary

## Overview

The KSI daemon has been updated to use a new multi-socket architecture with async completion flow and targeted pub/sub for efficiency.

## Key Changes

### 1. Multi-Socket Architecture

The daemon now uses specialized sockets:
- **admin.sock**: System administration (HEALTH_CHECK, GET_PROCESSES, SHUTDOWN)
- **agents.sock**: Agent lifecycle (REGISTER_AGENT, SPAWN_AGENT, GET_AGENTS)
- **messaging.sock**: Events and messages (SUBSCRIBE, PUBLISH, AGENT_CONNECTION)
- **state.sock**: Agent state (SET_AGENT_KV, GET_AGENT_KV)
- **completion.sock**: LLM completions (COMPLETION)

### 2. New Completion Flow

**Old way (SPAWN command)**:
```python
# Synchronous, single socket
response = await client.spawn_claude(prompt)
```

**New way (COMPLETION command)**:
```python
# Asynchronous, event-driven
response = await client.create_completion(prompt)
```

The new flow:
1. Client subscribes to COMPLETION_RESULT events on messaging socket
2. Client sends COMPLETION request to completion socket
3. Daemon returns immediate acknowledgment with request_id
4. When complete, result is published as COMPLETION_RESULT event
5. Client receives result via messaging subscription

### 3. Targeted Pub/Sub

Instead of broadcasting all COMPLETION_RESULT events to all clients:

**Option 1: Direct Delivery** (implemented)
- COMPLETION_RESULT events include a "to" field with client_id
- Message bus delivers directly to the target client
- No filtering needed, better privacy

**Option 2: Dynamic Subscriptions** (supported)
- Clients can subscribe to "COMPLETION_RESULT:client_id"
- Only receive their own events

**Option 3: Enhanced Message Bus** (available)
- Channel-based subscriptions
- Topic filtering
- Pattern matching

### 4. Client Libraries

#### Multi-Socket Client (`daemon/client/multi_socket_client.py`)
- Full support for all sockets
- Async completion handling
- Event subscriptions
- Automatic connection management

#### Simple Chat Client (`SimpleChatClient`)
- High-level interface for chat applications
- Handles session management
- Similar API to old SPAWN interface

### 5. Updated Interfaces

#### chat_textual.py
- Now uses SimpleChatClient
- Supports new completion flow
- Test modes: `--test-connection`, `--send-message`
- Backwards compatible UI

#### chat_simple.py
- Minimal CLI chat interface
- Reference implementation
- No TUI dependencies

## Migration Guide

### For Client Code

```python
# Old way
from daemon.client import AsyncClient
client = AsyncClient()
response = await client.spawn_claude(prompt, session_id=session)

# New way
from daemon.client.multi_socket_client import SimpleChatClient
client = SimpleChatClient()
response, session_id = await client.send_prompt(prompt, session)
```

### For Direct Socket Communication

```python
# Old way - single socket
cmd = {"command": "SPAWN", "parameters": {...}}
response = await send_to_socket("sockets/claude_daemon.sock", cmd)

# New way - appropriate socket
cmd = {"command": "COMPLETION", "parameters": {...}}
response = await send_to_socket("sockets/completion.sock", cmd)
```

## Testing

### Test Scripts
- `test_new_architecture.py`: Comprehensive test suite
- `chat_simple.py`: Simple interactive test
- `interfaces/chat_textual.py --test-connection`: Connection test

### Test the Completion Flow
```bash
# Simple test
python chat_simple.py

# Send single message
python interfaces/chat_textual.py --send-message "Hello, Claude"

# Full test suite
python test_new_architecture.py
```

## Benefits

1. **Efficiency**: Targeted delivery reduces unnecessary network traffic
2. **Privacy**: Clients only receive their own completion results
3. **Scalability**: Better separation of concerns across sockets
4. **Flexibility**: Support for different subscription patterns
5. **Event-Driven**: No polling, clean async architecture

## Backwards Compatibility

- Old SPAWN commands are deprecated but could be supported via adapter
- Single socket connections can still work for some commands
- Existing log formats preserved

## Next Steps

1. Update daemon to use EnhancedMessageBus for full targeted pub/sub
2. Migrate remaining interfaces to new client libraries
3. Add metrics and monitoring for the new architecture
4. Update documentation and examples
