# Underutilized KSI Features & Enhancement Opportunities

This document highlights powerful KSI features that are underutilized and suggests enhancements based on deeper understanding of the daemon.

## 1. Graph Database State System

### Current Reality
KSI has a **full-featured graph database**, not just a key-value store:
- Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) model with flexible properties
- Directed relationships with metadata
- Graph traversal algorithms (BFS with depth control)
- Temporal tracking (created_at, updated_at)
- Bulk operations for atomic multi-entity creation

### Opportunities
1. **Agent Relationship Modeling**
   ```python
   # Model complex agent hierarchies
   coordinator → spawned → [worker1, worker2, worker3]
   worker1 → observes → worker2
   worker2 → depends_on → shared_resource
   ```

2. **Knowledge Graphs**
   ```python
   # Build semantic networks
   concept1 → related_to → concept2
   agent → discovered → insight
   insight → supports → hypothesis
   ```

3. **Workflow DAGs**
   ```python
   # Model workflows as directed acyclic graphs
   stage1 → triggers → stage2
   stage2 → blocks → stage3 (until condition met)
   ```

## 2. Observation System with History

### Current Reality
- Event subscription and routing between agents
- Pattern-based filtering
- **Historical event replay** capabilities
- Checkpoint/restore support
- Circuit breaker for resilience

### Opportunities
1. **Time-Travel Debugging**
   ```python
   # Replay events from a specific point
   await obs_tool.replay_from_checkpoint(
       checkpoint_id="before_bug",
       until_event="error_occurred"
   )
   ```

2. **Learning from History**
   ```python
   # Analyze successful patterns
   successful_runs = await obs_tool.query_history(
       filters={"outcome": "success"},
       time_window="7d"
   )
   ```

## 3. Message Bus for Inter-Agent Communication

### Current Reality
- Pub/sub messaging system
- Offline message queuing
- Topic-based subscriptions
- Message history tracking

### Opportunities
1. **Agent Broadcast Networks**
   ```python
   # Broadcast discoveries to interested agents
   await message_bus.publish(
       topic="discoveries.security",
       message={"vulnerability": "SQL injection", "severity": "high"}
   )
   ```

2. **Collaborative Problem Solving**
   ```python
   # Agents subscribe to problem domains
   await message_bus.subscribe(
       agent_id=solver.id,
       topics=["problems.optimization", "problems.algorithmic"]
   )
   ```

## 4. Orchestration Service

### Current Reality
- Declarative workflow patterns from YAML
- Agent lifecycle management
- Message routing rules with wildcards
- Turn-taking and coordination primitives

### Opportunities
1. **Complex Multi-Agent Patterns**
   ```yaml
   # Debate orchestration
   orchestration:
     name: structured_debate
     agents:
       - role: moderator
       - role: proponent
       - role: opponent
     turns:
       - agent: moderator
         action: introduce_topic
       - parallel:
         - agent: proponent
           action: present_argument
         - agent: opponent
           action: prepare_rebuttal
   ```

2. **Adaptive Workflows**
   ```python
   # Modify orchestration based on progress
   if debate.heat_level > 0.8:
       await orchestration.inject_step("cool_down_period")
   ```

## 5. Correlation Tracing

### Current Reality
- Full event chain tracing
- Parent-child correlation tracking
- Timing and performance metrics
- Error propagation tracking

### Opportunities
1. **Performance Optimization**
   ```python
   # Find bottlenecks in agent chains
   traces = await correlation.get_slow_chains(
       threshold_ms=5000
   )
   ```

2. **Causality Analysis**
   ```python
   # Trace why an error occurred
   root_cause = await correlation.trace_error_origin(
       error_event_id="xyz123"
   )
   ```

## 6. Injection Router

### Current Reality
- System-reminder injection for completion chains
- Circuit breaker with depth tracking
- Parent-child request tracking
- Token budget management (placeholder)

### Opportunities
1. **Dynamic Context Injection**
   ```python
   # Inject relevant context based on conversation
   if "security" in conversation_topics:
       await injection.add_context("security_guidelines.md")
   ```

2. **Adaptive Token Management**
   ```python
   # Adjust context based on token budget
   if remaining_tokens < 1000:
       await injection.use_summary_mode()
   ```

## 7. Event Log System

### Current Reality
- High-performance JSONL logging
- SQLite metadata for fast queries
- Pattern matching with SQL LIKE
- Large payload separation
- Daily rotation

### Opportunities
1. **Event Mining**
   ```python
   # Find patterns in agent behavior
   patterns = await event_log.mine_patterns(
       event_types=["agent:decision:*"],
       min_frequency=10
   )
   ```

2. **Anomaly Detection**
   ```python
   # Detect unusual agent behavior
   anomalies = await event_log.detect_anomalies(
       baseline_period="7d",
       sensitivity=0.95
   )
   ```

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Graph Visualization API
```python
@event_handler("state:graph:visualize")
async def visualize_graph(data):
    """Generate graph visualization data"""
    return {
        "nodes": [...],  # D3.js compatible
        "edges": [...],
        "layout": "force-directed"
    }
```

### 2. Agent Learning System
```python
@event_handler("agent:learn:pattern")
async def learn_from_success(data):
    """Store successful patterns for reuse"""
    pattern = analyze_success_pattern(data)
    await pattern_library.store(pattern)
```

### 3. Workflow Templates
```python
@event_handler("workflow:from_template")
async def create_workflow_from_template(data):
    """Instantiate workflow from template"""
    template = workflow_templates[data["template"]]
    return instantiate_with_bindings(template, data["bindings"])
```

### 4. Smart Observation Filtering
```python
@event_handler("observation:smart_subscribe")
async def smart_subscribe(data):
    """Subscribe with ML-based relevance filtering"""
    filter_model = load_relevance_model(data["interest_profile"])
    return create_filtered_subscription(filter_model)
```

### 5. Graph-Based Resource Management
```python
@event_handler("resource:allocate_graph")
async def allocate_resources_by_graph(data):
    """Allocate resources based on graph relationships"""
    dependencies = await traverse_dependency_graph(data["root_entity"])
    return allocate_with_priorities(dependencies)
```

## Integration Opportunities
