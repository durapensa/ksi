# ksi_claude_code Changelog

## Major Refactoring - Alignment with KSI Architecture

### Key Realizations
- Agents maintain continuous context through the conversation system
- Every message to an agent continues the conversation (no "prompt modification")
- The observation system provides real-time monitoring (no need for daemon streaming)
- Compositions can be created/edited dynamically via events
- Session IDs are managed by claude-cli (new ID returned with each response)

### Changes Made

#### 1. Core Architecture Updates
- **ksi_base_tool.py**: Now properly uses event system with error handling
- **agent_spawn_tool.py**: Uses `completion:async` event, proper session management
- **observation_tools.py**: Leverages actual observation system with subscriptions
- **state_management_tools.py**: Simplified to match KSI's key-value store

#### 2. New Practical Tools
- **conversation_tools.py**: Manage ongoing agent conversations
- **composition_tools.py**: Create/edit agent profiles dynamically
- **practical_examples.py**: Real-world usage patterns

#### 3. Removed Theoretical Concepts
- Moved theoretical explorations to THEORETICAL_CONCEPTS.md
- Removed cognitive_scaffolding_tools.py (too abstract)
- Removed prompt_engineering_tools.py (replaced with conversation tools)
- Removed unnecessary complexity from orchestrations

#### 4. Documentation Updates
- **CLAUDE_CODE_KSI_MANUAL.md**: Now focused on practical usage
- **README.md**: Clear, practical getting started guide
- **PRACTICAL_GUIDE.md**: Step-by-step examples

### Key Patterns Now Supported

1. **Continuous Conversations**
   ```python
   # Start conversation
   result = await conv_tool.start_conversation("researcher", "Analyze this codebase")
   
   # Continue guiding the agent
   result = await conv_tool.continue_conversation(
       result["session_id"], 
       "Focus on the security aspects"
   )
   ```

2. **Real-time Observation**
   ```python
   # Monitor agent progress
   async for update in obs_tool.observe_agent(session_id):
       print(f"Progress: {update}")
   ```

3. **Dynamic Compositions**
   ```python
   # Create custom agent profile
   comp_id = await comp_tool.create_composition(
       "security_analyst",
       components=[...],
       capabilities={"file_access": True, "network_access": True}
   )
   ```

### Migration Guide

If you were using the old theoretical approach:
1. Replace prompt modification attempts with conversation continuation
2. Use observation subscriptions instead of expecting streaming
3. Track session_ids properly (they change with each response)
4. Use the conversation system for multi-phase interactions

### Benefits
- Aligns with KSI's actual capabilities
- Removes workarounds and misconceptions
- Provides practical, working patterns
- Simplifies the mental model
- Enables real multi-agent orchestration
