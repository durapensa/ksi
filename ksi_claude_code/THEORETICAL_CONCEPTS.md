# Theoretical Concepts (Archived)

This document contains theoretical explorations that were moved from the main manual to keep it focused on practical implementation.

## Intelligence Engineering Laboratory

The ultimate realization is that KSI + composition system gives me a **laboratory for engineering intelligence itself**. I'm not just using tools or orchestrating agents - I'm conducting experiments in cognitive architecture.

### Prompt as Assembly Language for Intelligence

```python
class CognitiveAssembler:
    """Treat prompts as assembly language for cognitive operations"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.instruction_set = {
            # Basic cognitive operations
            "FOCUS": lambda target: f"Focus your analysis on {target}",
            "ABSTRACT": lambda level: f"Think at abstraction level {level}",
            "CONTRAST": lambda a, b: f"Compare and contrast {a} with {b}",
            "SYNTHESIZE": lambda inputs: f"Synthesize insights from: {inputs}",
            "CRITIQUE": lambda target: f"Critically evaluate {target}",
            
            # Meta-cognitive operations
            "REFLECT": lambda: "Reflect on your reasoning process",
            "UNCERTAINTY": lambda: "Express uncertainty levels explicitly",
            "ASSUMPTIONS": lambda: "State your assumptions clearly",
            
            # Behavioral modifiers
            "ITERATE": lambda n: f"Iterate your analysis {n} times",
            "PARALLEL": lambda paths: f"Explore these paths in parallel: {paths}",
            "RECURSIVE": lambda depth: f"Apply this recursively to depth {depth}",
        }
```

### Theory Building Through Experimentation

```python
class IntelligenceTheorist:
    """Build theories of intelligence through systematic experimentation"""
    
    async def test_hypothesis(self, hypothesis: str):
        """Test a hypothesis about intelligence/cognition"""
        
        # Design experiments
        experiments = await self.design_experiments(hypothesis)
        
        results = []
        for exp in experiments:
            # Create control agent
            control = await agent_tool.spawn(
                prompt=exp.control_prompt,
                profile=exp.control_profile
            )
            
            # Create experimental agents
            experimental_agents = []
            for variant in exp.variants:
                agent = await agent_tool.spawn(
                    prompt=self.apply_variant(exp.control_prompt, variant),
                    profile=self.apply_variant(exp.control_profile, variant)
                )
                experimental_agents.append(agent)
            
            # Run trials
            trial_results = await self.run_trials(
                control, 
                experimental_agents,
                exp.test_cases
            )
            
            results.append(trial_results)
        
        # Analyze results
        analysis = await self.analyze_results(results, hypothesis)
        
        # Update theory
        if analysis.supports_hypothesis:
            await self.update_theory(hypothesis, analysis.evidence)
        else:
            await self.revise_hypothesis(hypothesis, analysis.counter_evidence)
        
        return analysis
```

### Real-Time Cognitive Architecture Adaptation

```python
class CognitiveArchitect:
    """Dynamically modify cognitive architecture during execution"""
    
    async def create_adaptive_agent(self, base_prompt: str):
        """Create agent that modifies its own cognitive architecture"""
        
        agent = await agent_tool.spawn(
            prompt=f"""{base_prompt}
            
            You have the ability to modify your own cognitive architecture by:
            1. Requesting new mental models: "INSTALL: <model_description>"
            2. Adjusting attention: "ATTENTION: <focus_area> <weight>"
            3. Adding constraints: "CONSTRAIN: <behavior> <rule>"
            4. Removing limitations: "UNCONSTRAIN: <limitation>"
            
            Monitor your own performance and adapt as needed.""",
            
            extra_config={
                "cognitive_adaptation": True,
                "self_modification_handler": self.handle_modification_request
            }
        )
        
        return agent

    """Search the space of possible cognitive architectures"""
    
    async def neural_architecture_search_for_prompts(self, task: str):
        """Find optimal cognitive architecture for task"""

        }
        
        # Initialize population
        architectures = await self.generate_diverse_architectures(search_space)

            scores = []
            for arch in architectures:
                score = await self.evaluate_architecture(arch, task)
                scores.append((arch, score))
            
            # Select best
            best = self.select_top_architectures(scores)
            
            # Generate new architectures
            new_architectures = []
            
            # Mutations
            for arch in best:
                mutated = await self.mutate_architecture(arch)
                new_architectures.append(mutated)

            architectures = new_architectures
        
        return max(scores, key=lambda x: x[1])[0]

### Prompt DSL Compiler

```python
class PromptDSL:
    """Domain-specific language for prompt engineering"""
    
    async def compile(self, dsl_code: str):
        """Compile DSL to optimized prompt"""

## Evolutionary Patterns

### Evolutionary Composition
```python
async def evolve_composition_for_task(task: str, generations: int = 10):
    """Use evolutionary algorithms to find optimal agent compositions"""
    
    # Start with diverse initial population
    population = await create_diverse_compositions(
        base_profiles=["researcher", "analyst", "developer"],
        variations=20
    )
    
    for gen in range(generations):
        # Test each composition
        results = []
        for composition in population:
            agent = await agent_tool.spawn(profile=composition)
            performance = await agent.attempt_task(task)
            results.append((composition, performance))
        
        # Select best performers
        top_performers = select_top(results, keep=0.3)
        
        # Create next generation through mutation and crossover
        population = await generate_next_population(
            parents=top_performers,
            mutation_rate=0.1,
            crossover_rate=0.7
        )
    
    return population[0]  # Best composition found
```

### Self-Improving Composition System

```python
class SelfImprovingCompositionSystem:
    """A system that learns to create better compositions over time"""
    
    async def initialize(self):
        # Create a composition architect agent
        self.architect = await agent_tool.spawn(
            profile="composition_architect",
            extra_config={
                "self_modifiable": true,
                "learning_enabled": true
            }
        )
        
        # Create a composition evaluator
        self.evaluator = await agent_tool.spawn(
            profile="composition_evaluator"
        )
    
    async def request_agent_for_task(self, task: str):
        # Architect designs composition
        design = await self.architect.design_for_task(task)
        
        # Spawn agent with designed composition
        agent = await agent_tool.spawn(profile=design.composition_name)
        
        # Monitor performance
        performance = await self.monitor_task_execution(agent, task)
        
        # Evaluate and learn
        evaluation = await self.evaluator.evaluate(design, performance)
        
        # Architect learns from evaluation
        await self.architect.learn_from_evaluation(evaluation)
        
        # Store successful patterns
        if evaluation.success_score > 0.8:
            await self.store_pattern(task_type, design, evaluation)
        
        return agent
```

## Intelligence Engineering Principles

Through KSI, I follow these principles for engineering intelligence:

1. **Empirical Approach** - Test hypotheses about cognition through experiments
2. **Compositional Building** - Build complex intelligence from simple, tested components
3. **Iterative Refinement** - Continuously improve based on performance data
4. **Theoretical Grounding** - Develop theories of what makes prompts/agents effective
5. **Meta-Learning** - Learn how to learn better through systematic exploration
6. **Emergent Complexity** - Allow complex behaviors to emerge from simple rules
7. **Adaptive Systems** - Build systems that improve themselves over time

These concepts represent aspirational capabilities and theoretical explorations. For practical implementation, see the main manual.
