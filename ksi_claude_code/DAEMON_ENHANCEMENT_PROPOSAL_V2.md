# KSI Daemon Enhancement Proposal V2

Based on deeper understanding of KSI's existing capabilities, this proposal focuses on genuine gaps and enhancements that would complement the already-powerful features.

## Key Discoveries

KSI already has:
- **Graph database** with entities, relationships, and traversal
- **Observation system** with history and replay
- **Message bus** for pub/sub communication
- **Orchestration service** with declarative workflows
- **Correlation tracing** for debugging
- **Event log** with pattern matching

## Genuine Gaps & Enhancement Opportunities

### 1. Graph Query Language (Priority: High)

**Current Gap**: While the graph database is powerful, it lacks a query language like Cypher or GraphQL.

**Proposed Enhancement**:
```python
@event_handler("state:graph:query")
async def graph_query(data):
    """Execute graph query in Cypher-like syntax"""
    # Example query:
    # MATCH (a:agent)-[:spawned]->(b:agent)
    # WHERE a.properties.role = 'coordinator'
    # RETURN a, b, count(b) as workers
    
    query = data["query"]
    params = data.get("params", {})
    
    result = await graph_engine.execute_query(query, params)
    return {
        "nodes": result.nodes,
        "relationships": result.relationships,
        "aggregations": result.aggregations
    }
```

**Benefits**:
- Complex graph queries without multiple API calls
- Pattern matching across entities and relationships
- Aggregations and graph algorithms (shortest path, centrality)

### 2. Agent Capability Evolution (Priority: High)

**Current Gap**: Agent capabilities are static after spawn.

**Proposed Enhancement**:
```python
@event_handler("agent:capability:evolve")
async def evolve_agent_capability(data):
    """Dynamically modify agent capabilities based on performance"""
    agent_id = data["agent_id"]
    performance_data = data["performance_data"]
    
    # Analyze what capabilities would help
    suggested_capabilities = await analyze_capability_gaps(
        agent_id, 
        performance_data
    )
    
    # Create new composition with evolved capabilities
    evolved_composition = await evolve_composition(
        current_composition=agent.composition,
        suggested_capabilities=suggested_capabilities,
        constraints=data.get("constraints", {})
    )
    
    # Hot-swap the composition (if supported by profile)
    return await agent.update_composition(evolved_composition)
```

**Benefits**:
- Agents that improve over time
- Adaptive capability management
- Performance-driven evolution

### 3. Distributed Graph Sharding (Priority: Medium)

**Current Gap**: Graph database is local to single daemon instance.

**Proposed Enhancement**:
```python
@event_handler("federation:graph:shard")
async def setup_graph_sharding(data):
    """Distribute graph across multiple daemons"""
    sharding_strategy = data["strategy"]  # by_entity_type, by_relationship, consistent_hash
    daemon_nodes = data["nodes"]
    
    # Setup sharding coordinator
    coordinator = await create_sharding_coordinator(
        strategy=sharding_strategy,
        nodes=daemon_nodes
    )
    
    # Rebalance existing graph
    await coordinator.rebalance_graph()
    
    return {
        "coordinator_id": coordinator.id,
        "shard_map": coordinator.get_shard_map()
    }
```

**Benefits**:
- Scale to massive graphs
- Distributed agent networks
- Cross-daemon graph queries

### 4. Time-Series Analysis for Events (Priority: High)

**Current Gap**: Event log lacks time-series analysis capabilities.

**Proposed Enhancement**:
```python
@event_handler("analytics:timeseries:analyze")
async def analyze_event_timeseries(data):
    """Perform time-series analysis on events"""
    metrics = data["metrics"]  # e.g., "agent_spawns_per_hour"
    time_range = data["time_range"]
    granularity = data.get("granularity", "hour")
    
    # Extract time series
    series = await event_log.extract_timeseries(
        metrics=metrics,
        time_range=time_range,
        granularity=granularity
    )
    
    # Perform analysis
    analysis = {
        "trends": detect_trends(series),
        "seasonality": detect_seasonality(series),
        "anomalies": detect_anomalies(series),
        "forecast": forecast_next_period(series)
    }
    
    return analysis
```

**Benefits**:
- Understand system behavior over time
- Predict resource needs
- Detect anomalous patterns

### 5. Workflow Composition Language (Priority: Medium)

**Current Gap**: Orchestrations are static YAML, can't be composed dynamically.

**Proposed Enhancement**:
```python
@event_handler("workflow:compose")
async def compose_workflow(data):
    """Compose workflows from smaller parts"""
    # Workflow DSL example:
    # workflow = SEQUENCE(
    #     PARALLEL(
    #         agent("analyzer").do("analyze", input),
    #         agent("researcher").do("research", input)
    #     ),
    #     agent("synthesizer").do("synthesize", results)
    # )
    
    workflow_ast = parse_workflow_dsl(data["workflow"])
    compiled = compile_workflow(workflow_ast)
    
    # Register and execute
    workflow_id = await orchestration.register(compiled)
    return await orchestration.execute(workflow_id, data["inputs"])
```

**Benefits**:
- Dynamic workflow creation
- Reusable workflow components
- Conditional and adaptive workflows

### 6. Graph-Aware Message Routing (Priority: Medium)

**Current Gap**: Message bus doesn't consider graph relationships.

**Proposed Enhancement**:
```python
@event_handler("message:route:graph")
async def route_message_by_graph(data):
    """Route messages based on graph relationships"""
    message = data["message"]
    routing_strategy = data["strategy"]
    
    if routing_strategy == "downstream":
        # Send to all entities this one spawned
        targets = await graph.get_descendants(
            entity_id=message["from"],
            relationship_type="spawned"
        )
    elif routing_strategy == "upstream":
        # Send to parent entities
        targets = await graph.get_ancestors(
            entity_id=message["from"],
            relationship_type="spawned"
        )
    elif routing_strategy == "siblings":
        # Send to entities with same parent
        targets = await graph.get_siblings(message["from"])
    
    # Route to all targets
    for target in targets:
        await message_bus.publish(
            topic=f"entity.{target.id}",
            message=message
        )
```

**Benefits**:
- Natural communication patterns
- Hierarchical message propagation
- Graph-based broadcast

### 7. Capability-Based Resource Limits (Priority: High)

**Current Gap**: No resource management tied to capabilities.

**Proposed Enhancement**:
```python
@event_handler("resource:capability:limits")
async def set_capability_resource_limits(data):
    """Define resource limits per capability"""
    capability_limits = {
        "spawn_agents": {
            "max_children": 10,
            "max_depth": 3,
            "rate_limit": "5/minute"
        },
        "state_write": {
            "max_entities": 1000,
            "max_relationships": 5000,
            "storage_quota": "100MB"
        },
        "network_access": {
            "rate_limit": "100/minute",
            "bandwidth": "10MB/s"
        }
    }
    
    # Apply limits to agents with capabilities
    affected_agents = await apply_capability_limits(capability_limits)
    
    return {
        "limits_applied": capability_limits,
        "affected_agents": len(affected_agents)
    }
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevent resource exhaustion
- Fair resource allocation
- Capability-aware throttling

### 8. Event Sourcing Projections (Priority: Low)

**Current Gap**: No built-in event sourcing projections.

**Proposed Enhancement**:
```python
@event_handler("projection:define")
async def define_projection(data):
    """Define event sourcing projections"""
    projection = {
        "name": data["name"],
        "events": data["events"],  # Event types to process
        "initial_state": data["initial_state"],
        "reducer": data["reducer"],  # How to update state
        "query": data["query"]  # How to query the projection
    }
    
    # Register and build projection
    projection_id = await projection_engine.register(projection)
    await projection_engine.rebuild(projection_id)
    
    return {"projection_id": projection_id}
```

**Benefits**:
- Derived views of system state
- Event sourcing patterns
- Efficient specialized queries

## Implementation Priorities
