# Quick Start for Next KSI Enhancement Session

## Immediate Actions

1. **Read the planning guide**: `ksi_claude_code/NEXT_SESSION_PLANNING_GUIDE.md`

2. **Start research tasks** (in parallel):
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Graph database investigation
   rg -t py "traverse|graph|entity|relationship" ksi_daemon/core/state.py -A 5
   
   # Terminal 2: Composition system
   rg "resolve|compile" ksi_daemon/composition/ -A 5
   
   # Terminal 3: Event patterns
   rg "@event_handler" ksi_daemon/ | grep -E "(state:|graph:|query)"
   ```

3. **Enter planning mode** after initial research

## Priority Focus Areas

### P0: Graph Query Language
**Why**: Unlocks complex agent network analysis
**Research**: How traversal works in `core/state.py`
**Quick win**: Simple pattern matching first

### P0: Time-Series Analytics  
**Why**: Understand system behavior over time
**Research**: Event log structure in `reference_event_log.py`
**Quick win**: Basic windowed aggregations

### P1: Agent Evolution
**Why**: Agents that improve themselves
**Research**: How compositions affect running agents
**Quick win**: Performance-based capability suggestions

## Key Questions to Answer

1. Can we add Cypher queries without major refactoring?
2. Does the event log have time-based indexes?
3. Can compositions be hot-swapped?
4. Where do resource limits naturally fit?

## Success Criteria

By end of session:
- [ ] Detailed implementation plan for one P0 enhancement
- [ ] Proof-of-concept for at least one quick win
- [ ] Clear understanding of implementation complexity
- [ ] Updated timeline and approach

## Remember

- **Think graphs, not lists** - Everything connects
- **Events are the interface** - Don't bypass the event system  
- **Incremental delivery** - Small working features first
- **Maintain compatibility** - Don't break existing clients
