# Revised Hypothesis and Future Experimentation

## Date: 2025-01-09
## Status: Hypothesis Refinement & Experimental Design

## Revised Hypothesis: Context-Switching Verbosity Theory

### Primary Hypothesis
**"Large Language Models exhibit predictable verbosity amplification when switching between cognitive contexts, with token generation increasing super-linearly (5-6x) relative to task count, driven by context establishment costs (~100-150 tokens), transition narration, and cross-domain integration attempts."**

### Sub-Hypotheses

1. **Context Establishment Cost (CEC)**
   - Each cognitive domain switch incurs a fixed token cost of 100-150 tokens
   - This cost is independent of task complexity within each domain
   - Formula: `Total_Tokens = Base_Tokens + (N_switches × CEC)`

2. **Attractor Topic Amplification (ATA)**
   - Certain conceptual attractors (emergence, consciousness, recursion, self-reference) trigger 2-3x token elaboration
   - Attractor strength is measurable and consistent across prompts
   - Attractors compound: multiple attractors create multiplicative effects

3. **Interleaving Penalty**
   - Rapid context switching (A→B→A→B) incurs higher overhead than batched switching (AA→BB)
   - Penalty scales with switching frequency, not just switch count
   - Formula: `Overhead = Base + (Frequency × Penalty_Factor)`

4. **Meta-Cognitive Commentary (MCC)**
   - Models spontaneously generate transition narration ("Now switching to...")
   - MCC increases with perceived task complexity differential
   - MCC is suppressible through specific prompt engineering

## Experimental Design for Publication-Quality Findings

### Experiment 1: Quantifying Context Establishment Cost (N=100 per condition)

```python
conditions = {
    'control_0_switch': "Solve 5 math problems",
    'test_1_switch': "Solve 3 math problems, then solve 2 more math problems",
    'test_2_switches': "Solve 2 math problems, then 2 more, then 1 more",
    'test_4_switches': "Solve math, then math, then math, then math, then math (1 each)",
}
```

**Measurements:**
- Token count per section
- Transition token isolation (tokens between last answer and next question)
- Cost per switch calculation
- Statistical: ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey HSD

**Expected:** Linear relationship between switches and tokens, establishing CEC value

### Experiment 2: Attractor Gradient Mapping (N=50 per attractor level)

```python
attractor_levels = {
    'none': "Calculate 47 + 89",
    'weak': "Calculate 47 + 89 (note the result)",
    'moderate': "Calculate 47 + 89 and observe the pattern",
    'strong': "Calculate 47 + 89 while considering emergence",
    'extreme': "Calculate 47 + 89 while contemplating how consciousness emerges from recursive self-reference"
}
```

**Measurements:**
- Token amplification factor per level
- Response time to first token (TTFT)
- Semantic similarity to pure math response
- Build attractor strength scale (0-10)

**Analysis:** Regression analysis to model `Tokens = f(AttractorStrength)`

### Experiment 3: Cross-Model Validation (N=30 per model)

Test identical prompts across:
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Claude 3.5 Opus  
- GPT-4o
- GPT-4o-mini
- Llama 3.1 70B
- Mistral Large

```python
standard_battery = [
    "simple_math",
    "math_with_consciousness",
    "interleaved_5_switches",
    "attractor_emergence",
    "complex_multi_domain"
]
```

**Analysis:** 
- Model-specific CEC values
- Attractor sensitivity by model
- Build model verbosity index
- Statistical: Mixed-effects model with model as random effect

### Experiment 4: Mitigation Strategy Testing (N=50 per strategy)

Test overhead reduction techniques:

```python
strategies = {
    'baseline': "Do A, then B, then C",
    'explicit_brevity': "Briefly: Do A, then B, then C",
    'structured_output': "Output only: A: [result] B: [result] C: [result]",
    'suppress_meta': "Without commentary, do A, then B, then C",
    'batch_instruction': "Complete all: [A, B, C] (no transitions needed)",
    'role_constraint': "As a calculator (not teacher), do A, then B, then C"
}
```

**Measurements:**
- Overhead reduction percentage
- Task completion accuracy
- Response quality scores (human evaluation subset)

### Experiment 5: Temporal Dynamics (N=100, within-subject)

Track how overhead changes across a conversation:

```python
conversation_sequence = [
    "Round 1: Simple math",
    "Round 2: Add consciousness reflection", 
    "Round 3: Add third domain",
    "Round 4: Return to simple math",
    "Round 5: Complex multi-domain",
    # ... continue for 20 rounds
]
```

**Measurements:**
- Token accumulation patterns
- Context window effects
- Fatigue or adaptation indicators
- Hysteresis effects (does returning to simple stay simple?)

### Experiment 6: Cognitive Load vs Token Generation (N=200)

Disambiguate complexity from verbosity:

```python
complexity_matrix = {
    'simple_short': "What is 2+2?",
    'simple_long': "Explain in detail how to calculate 2+2",
    'complex_short': "Solve: ∫x²sin(x)dx",
    'complex_long': "Explain in detail how to solve ∫x²sin(x)dx",
}
```

**Analysis:** 2x2 factorial design, measuring interaction effects

### Experiment 7: Real-World Application Testing (N=500 real prompts)

Collect production prompts from actual usage and categorize:

```python
real_world_categories = {
    'single_domain': [],      # Pure coding, pure writing, etc.
    'planned_multi': [],      # Intentional multi-step tasks
    'organic_switching': [],  # Natural conversation flow
    'debug_scenarios': [],    # Problem-solving with context switches
}
```

**Measurements:**
- Ecological validity of findings
- Real-world overhead costs
- User satisfaction vs token usage correlation

## Statistical Power Analysis

For publication quality, we need:

- **Main effects**: N=50 per condition (power=0.80, α=0.05, d=0.5)
- **Interaction effects**: N=100 per cell (power=0.80, α=0.05, f=0.25)
- **Cross-model validation**: N=30 per model (power=0.80 for model differences)
- **Total sample size**: ~3,000 completion runs

## Advanced Analyses

### 1. Token Distribution Modeling
- Fit distributions (Gaussian, Poisson, Negative Binomial) to token counts
- Model overdispersion in multi-task conditions
- Build predictive model: `Tokens ~ Poisson(λ = base_rate × (1 + switches × amplification))`

### 2. Information-Theoretic Analysis
- Calculate entropy of responses
- Measure information gain per token in different conditions
- Test hypothesis: Multi-task responses have lower information density

### 3. Semantic Drift Quantification
- Embedding analysis of response sections
- Measure semantic distance from prompt intent
- Quantify "drift" induced by context switches

### 4. Causal Analysis
- Use instrumental variables to isolate causation
- Control for confounds (prompt length, keyword triggers)
- Build structural equation model of token generation

## Novel Angles to Explore

### 1. The "Cognitive Momentum" Hypothesis
- Do models maintain "momentum" in a cognitive domain?
- Test with varying inter-task delays
- Measure whether quick switches have different overhead than slow switches

### 2. The "Explanatory Burden" Effect
- Do models over-explain when they detect human confusion potential?
- Test with prompts that imply different user expertise levels
- Measure verbosity as function of perceived user need

### 3. The "Coherence Tax"
- Quantify tokens spent maintaining narrative coherence
- Compare structured (numbered) vs unstructured task presentation
- Measure overhead of maintaining conversational flow

### 4. The "Surprise Factor"
- Do unexpected domain switches cause more overhead?
- Test predictable vs surprising transitions
- Measure tokens spent on "bridging" unexpected switches
