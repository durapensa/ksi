# Session Continuity for System Engineering Work

## Context Management Problem

Complex system engineering sessions build valuable context that must be preserved across context limits and session boundaries.

## Current Session Essence (2025-06-20)

### Major Accomplishments
1. **Prompt Composition System**: Built complete YAML+Markdown composition engine
   - `prompts/` directory with modular components and compositions
   - `composer.py` engine with validation and discovery
   - Integrated with `autonomous_researcher.py` - no more hard-coded prompts
   - Community-ready architecture with specifications

2. **Memory System Architecture**: Implemented audience-specific knowledge stores
   - `memory/` directory separated by Claude instance type
   - Discovery protocol starting with `memory/README.md`
   - Clean separation between Claude Code, spawned agents, and system engineering knowledge

3. **Workspace Isolation**: Established agent workspace system
   - `autonomous_experiments/workspaces/{experiment_name}/` structure
   - Prevents system contamination from autonomous agent scripts
   - Documented in memory stores and prompt components

### Key Technical Decisions
- **YAML compositions + Markdown components**: Git-friendly, community-shareable format
- **Programmatic prompt injection**: Reliable delivery vs assumption-based memory reading
- **Audience separation**: Different knowledge for different Claude instance types
- **Systematic over ad-hoc**: Replaced hard-coded templates with composition system

### Current System State
- All 5 autonomous experiments successfully launched using composed prompts
- Memory system operational with discovery and validation tools
- Prompt composition integrated and tested in production
- Git commits: Memory system and prompt composition work staged and committed

### Integration Points
- `autonomous_researcher.py`: Uses `PromptComposer` with experiment configurations
- `memory/discover.py`: Programmatic access to memory system
- `prompts/composer.py`: Core composition engine with CLI interface

### Immediate Context: Claude Code `/compact`
- User reported approaching context limits in current session
- Claude Code has `/compact` command for intelligent conversation compression
- Need pattern for transferring session essence to new orchestrator sessions

## Session Continuity Protocol

### For Context Limits in Active Session
1. Use Claude Code's `/compact` command to compress conversation intelligently
2. `/compact` preserves technical details while summarizing discussion
3. Continue work in same session with freed context space

### For New Orchestrator Sessions
1. **Read memory system first**: Start with `memory/README.md`
2. **Check recent commits**: `git log --oneline -10` for latest work
3. **Read session essence**: This file for architectural context
4. **Identify current phase**: Where the work stands and what's next

### For Future Enhancement
Consider building automated session essence extraction from `claude_logs/` to create compacted context handoffs between orchestrator sessions.

## Key Patterns Established

### System Engineering Before Experiments
- Document architecture decisions in memory before implementation
- Test protocols and validate behavior against documentation
- Capture knowledge immediately when discovered

### Composition Over Hard-coding
- Use systematic prompt composition instead of embedded templates
- Store all prompts in git-tracked files
- Enable community collaboration through standardized formats

### Memory System Usage
- Update memory stores immediately when patterns emerge
- Separate knowledge by audience to prevent confusion
- Design for discoverability and systematic access
