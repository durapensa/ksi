# Old Docstring Patterns Analysis

## Summary

After searching git history before commit 8225bb1 (TypedDict migration start), I found that the codebase had minimal parameter documentation in docstrings. The existing patterns were:

### 1. Minimal Event Handler Docstrings

Most event handlers had single-line docstrings with no parameter documentation:

```python
@event_handler("agent:spawn")
async def handle_spawn_agent(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Spawn a new agent thread with optional profile."""
    # Implementation...

@event_handler("composition:compose") 
async def handle_compose(data: CompositionComposeData) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Compose a complete configuration from components."""
    # Implementation...
```

### 2. TypedDict Definitions Without Rich Documentation

TypedDict classes existed but had minimal documentation:

```python
class AgentTerminateData(TypedDict):
    """Type-safe data for agent:terminate."""
    agent_id: str
    force: NotRequired[bool]

class AgentSendMessageData(TypedDict):
    """Type-safe data for agent:send_message."""
    agent_id: str
    message: Dict[str, Any]
```

### 3. No Inline Comments in TypedDict

The old TypedDict definitions did not use inline comments to document:
- Default values
- Validation constraints
- Parameter relationships
- Allowed values

### 4. No "Parameters:" Sections

None of the docstrings used formal "Parameters:" sections. The documentation style was:
- Brief one-line descriptions
- No parameter-by-parameter documentation
- No mention of defaults, constraints, or validation

## Key Finding

The codebase did NOT have a rich docstring documentation tradition to preserve. The TypedDict migration is an opportunity to ADD documentation that was missing, not to preserve existing patterns.

## Implications for Discovery System

Since there are no existing docstring patterns to extract from:
1. We should focus on TypedDict inline comments as the primary documentation source
2. The discovery system should not attempt to parse docstrings for parameter info
3. All parameter documentation should be added as inline comments in TypedDict definitions

## Recommendation

Instead of trying to extract non-existent docstring patterns, we should:
1. Enhance TypedDict definitions with rich inline comments
2. Use the structured comment format already implemented in discovery
3. Not worry about "preserving" docstring documentation that never existed
