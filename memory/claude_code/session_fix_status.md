# Session Fix Status Report

## What We Fixed
1. **Session Manager no longer creates fake sessions** - `get_or_create_session` now returns None for unknown sessions
2. **Session tracking updated** - When claude-cli returns a new session_id, we properly track it via `update_request_session`
3. **Direct completions work** - Test completion succeeded and returned proper session_id

## What's Working
- Direct `completion:async` calls work correctly
- Session tracking is properly updated when claude-cli returns
- No more "Completing request for unknown session None" warnings (for new requests)
- Composition index rebuilt successfully (44 compositions)

## What's Not Working
- Agents spawn successfully but don't process messages
- No completion requests are generated from agents
- Agent threads seem to start but then go silent

## Hypothesis
The agent system might be failing because:
1. Agent initialization might expect a session to already exist
2. The agent thread might be crashing silently when trying to use the session manager
3. There might be a dependency on the old "create session" behavior somewhere in the agent flow

## Next Steps
1. Check agent thread implementation to see how it uses sessions
2. Look for any code that expects `get_or_create_session` to always return a valid session
3. Add more logging to understand why agents aren't processing messages
4. Consider if we need to handle agent initialization differently with the new session tracking

## Key Insight
The fix works for direct completions but breaks agent functionality. This suggests agents have a different initialization path that depends on the old session creation behavior.
