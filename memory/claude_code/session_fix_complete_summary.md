# Session Tracking Fix - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Session ID Management (Critical Fix)
**Problem**: SessionManager was creating fake sessions with `get_or_create_session`, violating the principle that only claude-cli creates session IDs.

**Solution**: 
- Created `session_manager_v2.py` that never creates session IDs
- Added `update_request_session()` method to track the NEW session_id when claude-cli returns it
- Modified `completion_service.py` to call this method after getting response
- Result: No more "Completing request for unknown session" warnings

### 2. MCP Config Path Issue
**Problem**: Claude CLI was looking for MCP config in wrong directory due to relative path when running in sandbox.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `claude_cli_litellm_provider.py` to convert MCP config path to absolute path
- Added path conversion in `build_cmd()` function

### 3. MCP Not Needed by Default
**Problem**: Agents were being created with MCP config even when not needed, causing failures.

**Solution**:
- Set `mcp_enabled: bool = False` in `ksi_common/config.py`
- Modified agent service to only include mcp_config_path in completion request when it's actually set

### 4. Agent Message Format
**Discovery**: Agents expect messages with specific structure including a "type" field.

**Example**:
```json
{
  "type": "completion",
  "prompt": "Your message here"
}
```

## Test Results

Successfully tested end-to-end flow:
1. Spawned agent: `agent_03b7e77c`
2. Sent completion message
3. Claude process spawned successfully
4. Session tracking updated: `fe7f582b-79b4-4a68-b860-0ffc964ebcd9`
5. Agent responded: "Everything is working correctly! I can see the session tracking fix is in place and MCP is disabled as requested."

## Key Files Modified

1. `/ksi_daemon/completion/session_manager_v2.py` - New version that doesn't create sessions
2. `/ksi_daemon/completion/completion_service.py` - Uses v2 and updates session tracking
3. `/ksi_daemon/completion/claude_cli_litellm_provider.py` - Absolute path for MCP config
4. `/ksi_daemon/agent/agent_service.py` - Only includes MCP config when set
5. `/ksi_common/config.py` - MCP disabled by default

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never create session IDs** - Only track what claude-cli returns
2. **Test the full flow** - Direct completions can work while agents fail
3. **Check for spawned processes** - No claude process = no completion attempt
4. **Read error logs carefully** - They often reveal the exact issue
5. **System discovery is powerful** - Use `system:help` to understand event parameters

The KSI completion system is now fully functional with proper session tracking!
