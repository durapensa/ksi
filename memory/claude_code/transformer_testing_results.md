# Transformer Testing Results
*Date: 2025-07-11*

## Summary

Successfully implemented and tested the declarative orchestration system with pattern-based transformers. The system is now functional but blocked on the composition system redesign.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Composition System Enhancement
- **Fixed**: Modified `composition:get` to return ALL YAML sections (not just core fields)
- **Added**: Raw YAML loading function to preserve custom sections like `transformers`
- **Result**: Patterns can now include arbitrary sections for consuming services

### 2. Transformer Service Integration
- **Fixed**: Response parsing to handle composition system format
- **Result**: Successfully loads transformers from pattern YAML files
- **Status**: All 3 test transformers loaded correctly

### 3. Event System Transformer Logic
- **Fixed**: Conditional transformation bug (transformers without conditions were ignored)
- **Result**: All transformer types now work correctly:
  - Sync transformers: ✅ Working
  - Async transformers: ✅ Working (with token response)
  - Conditional transformers: ✅ Working

## Test Results

### Test Pattern: `test_transformer_flow.yaml`

1. **Sync Transformer**: `test:hello` → `agent:send_message`
   - Status: ✅ Transformed successfully
   - Issue: Template variables not substituted (e.g., `{{message}}` remained literal)
   - Result: Event routed correctly but agent not found (expected)

2. **Conditional Transformer**: `test:conditional` → `orchestration:track`
   - Status: ✅ Condition evaluated and transformation applied
   - Condition: `priority == 'high'` passed correctly
   - Result: Event transformed and data mapped successfully

3. **Async Transformer**: `test:async_task` → `completion:async`
   - Status: ✅ Async pattern working
   - Result: Token returned with transform_id
   - Response routing: Ready for implementation

## Current Limitations

1. **Template Substitution**: Simple `{{variable}}` syntax not fully implemented
   - Nested paths work (e.g., `{{data.field}}`)
   - Direct variable substitution needs enhancement

2. **Response Routing**: Async transformer responses not yet routed back
   - `_handle_async_response` method exists but needs testing
   - Response correlation via transform_id is ready

3. **Orchestration Integration**: Pattern-aware orchestrators need testing
   - Transformers load successfully
   - DSL interpretation pending full orchestrator testing

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Unblocked)
1. Fix template variable substitution in `_apply_mapping`
2. Test response routing for async transformers
3. Create pattern-aware orchestrator and test DSL execution

### Blocked (Requires Composition Redesign)
1. Full implementation per `docs/GENERIC_COMPOSITION_SYSTEM_REDESIGN.md`
2. Service-specific validation framework
3. Hot-reload support for pattern updates

## Technical Notes

### Key Files Modified
- `/ksi_daemon/composition/composition_service.py`: Added raw YAML loading
- `/ksi_daemon/transformer/transformer_service.py`: Fixed response parsing
- `/ksi_daemon/event_system.py`: Fixed conditional transformation logic

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Load transformers
echo '{"event": "transformer:load_pattern", "data": {"pattern": "test_transformer_flow", "source": "testing"}}' | nc -U var/run/daemon.sock

# List loaded transformers
echo '{"event": "router:list_transformers", "data": {}}' | nc -U var/run/daemon.sock

# Test transformations
cat /tmp/test_event.json | nc -U var/run/daemon.sock
```

## Conclusion

The transformer system is fundamentally working. With minor enhancements to template substitution and response routing, the declarative orchestration system will be fully operational for pattern-aware agents to use natural language DSL with event transformations.
