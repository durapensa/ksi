    This pattern simply echoes messages through agents to test communication flow.
    No complex reasoning or expensive operations.

    WHEN receiving_test_request:
      ACKNOWLEDGE with "Test pattern loaded"
      
      IF message CONTAINS "echo":
        RESPOND with "ECHO: {{message}}"
      
      IF message CONTAINS "spawn":
        SPAWN single_agent WITH:
          profile: "base_single_agent"
          prompt: "You are a simple echo agent. Respond with 'ECHO: [message]' for any input."
        
        SEND to spawned_agent: "Hello from orchestrator"
        WAIT for response
        RELAY response to user
      
      IF message CONTAINS "count":
        COUNT to 3:
          - EMIT "orchestration:track" WITH {type: "count", value: {{index}}}
          - RESPOND "Count: {{index}}"
      
      ALWAYS:
        TRACK decision: "Processed test message"
        RESPOND "Test complete"
