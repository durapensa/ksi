# State Service Transformers
# 
# The state service itself has no specific transformers since it provides
# the core state management functionality. State-related transformers are
# defined in state_config_propagation.yaml which handles propagation of
# state changes to other services.
#
# This file exists to suppress the "no_transformers" warning during startup.
