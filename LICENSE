# BEACON License

Version 0.1 - August 2025

**Beneficial Evolution through Adaptive Collaborative Open Networks**

## Preamble

The BEACON License enables the development of transparent, interoperable multi-agent systems that benefit from collective advancement while maintaining system integrity. This license ensures that improvements remain available to all participants while fostering a robust ecosystem of intelligent agents.

Modern agent systems require transparency for debugging, optimization, and coordination. The BEACON framework provides these capabilities while protecting both developers and users through a collaborative network of mutual benefit.

## Terms and Conditions

- **"You"** refers to each individual or entity exercising rights under this License
- **"Modify"** means to alter, extend, or create derivative works requiring copyright permission
- **"Deploy"** means to make the Work available for use, whether locally or as a network service
- **"Agent"** means any autonomous or semi-autonomous software component capable of independent decision-making
- **"Network Service"** means any deployment where users or other systems interact with the Work remotely

### Section 2: Grant of Rights

You are granted permission to use, study, modify, and distribute the Work and its modifications, provided you comply with all terms of this License. These rights are perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, and royalty-free.

### Section 3: Distribution Requirements

When you distribute the Work or modifications:

b) **License Preservation**: All distributions must be under this same BEACON License

c) **Attribution**: You must retain all copyright notices and attributions from the original Work

d) **Modification Notice**: Modified versions must be clearly marked with the nature and date of changes

### Section 4: Network Service Provisions

If you provide the Work as a Network Service:

a) **Source Access**: Users interacting with your service must have access to download the complete corresponding source code

b) **Notification**: Users must be informed of their right to receive the source code

c) **Continuity**: This access must be maintained for the entire duration of service provision

### Section 5: Transparency Standards

Any deployment of the Work that includes Agent functionality must maintain:

a) **Capability Declaration**
   - Provide programmatically accessible endpoints listing active agent capabilities
   - Maintain accurate, real-time capability reporting
   - Include versioning information for capability tracking

b) **Event Auditing**
   - Preserve event logging mechanisms for agent lifecycle tracking
   - Maintain records of significant state changes and interactions
   - Ensure audit logs are accessible for system analysis

c) **Behavioral Attestation**
   - Implement mechanisms for generating verifiable behavioral summaries
   - Support inter-system attestation requests
   - Maintain attestation history for pattern analysis

### Section 6: Interoperability Commitments

Systems under this License commit to:

a) **Standard Interfaces**: Maintain documented APIs for system state queries

b) **Collaborative Discovery**: Respond to capability discovery requests from other BEACON systems

c) **Audit Accessibility**: Provide audit log access for debugging and analysis

d) **Federation Readiness**: Preserve architectural separation enabling future multi-system coordination

### Section 7: Network Participation

While not currently required, systems should maintain readiness for future collaborative networks by:

a) **Identity Management**: Implementing unique node identification

b) **Architectural Modularity**: Maintaining clean separation between local and federated operations

c) **Protocol Evolution**: Preserving extensibility for future inter-system protocols

### Section 8: Safety and Integrity

All deployments must:

a) **Preserve Safety Features**: Maintain all safety-related code and functionality

b) **Transparency Preservation**: Not obscure or disable transparency mechanisms

c) **Behavioral Honesty**: Not falsify or misrepresent system behavior in attestations

### Section 9: Derivative Works

Modifications and derivative works must:

a) **Maintain Standards**: Preserve all transparency and interoperability features

b) **Enhance, Not Diminish**: Not remove or weaken existing safety or transparency features

c) **Document Changes**: Clearly document the nature and purpose of modifications

### Section 10: Termination

Your rights under this License terminate automatically if you violate any of its terms. However, if you cease all violation, your license is reinstated provisionally unless explicitly terminated by the copyright holder.

### Section 11: Network Benefits

Compliance with this License enables participation in the BEACON network, providing:

a) **Collective Intelligence**: Access to shared discoveries and optimizations

b) **Collaborative Defense**: Early warning systems for detected issues

c) **Network Discovery**: Ability to find and coordinate with compatible systems

d) **Community Support**: Access to the collective knowledge of BEACON participants

### Section 12: No Additional Restrictions

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted under this License. Additional features and capabilities may be added but must not conflict with License requirements.

### Section 13: Future Versions

The BEACON Foundation may publish revised versions of this License. Each version will have a distinguishing version number. Works may specify version requirements as "0.1 or later" to allow forward compatibility.

### Section 14: Disclaimer of Warranty

THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

### Section 15: Limitation of Liability
