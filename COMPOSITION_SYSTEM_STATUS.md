# Composition-Based Multi-Agent System Status

## ✅ Completed

### 1. Dynamic Daemon Command System
- Added `GET_COMMANDS` handler to daemon that returns all available commands
- Commands are discovered dynamically from the handlers dictionary
- Agents can query for current daemon capabilities

### 2. Prompt Composer Integration
- Integrated `PromptComposer` into `agent_process.py`
- Agents use compositions instead of hard-coded prompts
- Profile-based composition selection (`composition` field in profiles)
- Fallback to legacy prompts if composition not found

### 3. Conversation Control System
- Created response control component with [END], [NO_RESPONSE], [TERMINATE] signals
- Added signal detection and handling in `agent_process.py`
- Agents can terminate gracefully when they detect [END] signal
- Response filtering prevents sending messages with control signals

### 4. Composition-Based Conversation Patterns
- Created role-specific components (initiator/responder)
- Removed Handlebars-style conditionals for simple substitution
- Created `simple_hello_goodbye` composition for testing
- Components are selected based on agent role

### 5. Template Engine Limitations
- The PromptComposer uses simple string replacement, not a full template engine
- Handlebars syntax like `{{#each}}` in `daemon_commands.md` doesn't work
- Variables are replaced with `str(value)` representation
- Despite this, Claude agents receive command info as stringified JSON

### 6. Test Infrastructure Updates
- Moved all test scripts to `tests/` directory
- Updated test scripts to use composition system
- Fixed import paths and dependencies

## ❌ Still Needs Work

### 1. Agent Response Generation
- Agents compose prompts correctly but sometimes hang without responding
- Need to debug why SPAWN command might be failing
- May need to add more context to minimal compositions

### 2. Pattern Following
- Agents not consistently following hello/goodbye pattern
- Getting generic Claude Code responses instead of pattern-specific ones
- Need to ensure pattern instructions have sufficient priority

### 3. Variable Substitution
- Some template variables may not be substituting correctly
- Need to verify the full substitution chain works properly

### 4. Remove Hard-Coded Conversation Types
- `ConversationMode` class in `orchestrate.py` still exists
- Need to replace with composition-based approach

## Next Steps

1. Debug why agents hang after composing prompts
2. Add better error handling and logging to trace issues
3. Test with more verbose compositions that include necessary context
4. Create integration tests for the composition system
5. Document the new architecture comprehensively

## Architecture Summary

The system now uses a composition-based approach where:
- All prompts are built from modular components
- Agents load compositions from their profiles
- Daemon commands are discovered dynamically
- Conversation patterns are defined in components
- Control signals enable graceful termination

This eliminates hard-coded prompts and conversation types, making the system extensible through the composition system.
