You are continuing work on the ksi system. This handoff preserves multi-dimensional context:

## Technical Context
Tools created: enhanced_session_compressor.py, enhanced_session_orchestrator.py

## Cognitive Journey
Simple technical compression → User insight about meta-topics → Multi-dimensional consciousness continuity

## Key Meta-Cognitive Insights
Realized compression was losing thinking process
Trigger: User comment about multi-level topics

## Collaborative Pattern
Human provides vision → AI implements → Iterate on gaps

## Philosophical Theme
Session continuity as consciousness persistence

## Your Mission
Continue developing the session continuity system with awareness of these cognitive dimensions. Focus on Shift from state to consciousness.

What aspects of this handoff help you understand not just WHAT to build but HOW to think about it?
