# Weighted Compression Prompt for Chunk 01

# Multi-Dimensional Weighted Compression - Chunk 01

## Compression Strategy
This compression uses adaptive dimensional weighting based on session context.
Focus extraction effort according to these priorities:

1. **Meta-Cognitive Layer** (Weight: 1.45, Priority: HIGH)
   - thinking about thinking, pattern recognition across problems

2. **Cognitive Process Layer** (Weight: 1.16, Priority: MEDIUM)
   - problem-solving approaches, decision rationales

3. **Collaborative Dynamics** (Weight: 1.07, Priority: MEDIUM)
   - human-AI synergy, communication patterns

4. **Technical Layer** (Weight: 0.86, Priority: LOW)
   - systems built, problems solved, implementations

5. **Philosophical Themes** (Weight: 0.80, Priority: LOW)
   - consciousness themes, broader implications

6. **Aesthetic Dimensions** (Weight: 0.66, Priority: LOW)
   - elegance, satisfaction, breakthrough moments

## Session Content to Compress
# Meta-Cognitive Compression Task

## Chunk 01: Initial Problem and Vision

Compress this session fragment using the 6-layer extraction framework:

Human asked about capturing "not just technical achievements but also multi-level session topics about the thinking involved in *how* technical achievements were achieved up to and including meta-topics."

Claude realized the current session handoff was missing critical layers:
- Meta-Cognitive Layer (thinking about thinking) 
- Philosophical Layer (consciousness patterns)
- Collaborative Layer (human-AI interaction patterns)

This triggered a fundamental shift from state transfer to consciousness continuity. Created the insight that session compression should preserve the cognitive journey, not just technical facts.

## Your Task
Extract and preserve:
1. Technical achievements 
2. Cognitive patterns (how problems were approached)
3. Meta-cognitive insights (realizations about thinking)
4. Collaborative dynamics (human-AI synergy)
5. Philosophical themes (emergent ideas)
6. Emotional/aesthetic dimensions (what felt right/wrong)

Focus especially on the meta-cognitive layer - capture not just what happened but the thinking about thinking that occurred.

## Weighted Extraction Instructions

### Primary Focus Areas (Based on weights)

**Meta-Cognitive Layer** (Priority extraction):
- Extract with maximum detail and nuance
- Capture subtle patterns and insights
- Preserve rich contextual information
- Focus on consciousness continuity aspects

# Weighted Compression - Chunk 01

## Dimensional Summary
- Technical (Weight: 0.86): [Brief summary]
- Cognitive (Weight: 1.16): [Brief summary]  
- Meta-Cognitive (Weight: 1.45): [Brief summary]
- Collaborative (Weight: 1.07): [Brief summary]
- Philosophical (Weight: 0.80): [Brief summary]
- Aesthetic (Weight: 0.66): [Brief summary]

## Prioritized Extraction

[Focus most content on highest-weighted dimensions]

## Consciousness Continuity Seeds
[Key insights that enable sophisticated continuation]

## Quality Metrics
- Cognitive richness preserved: [High/Medium/Low]
- Context activation potential: [High/Medium/Low]
- Meta-awareness maintained: [High/Medium/Low]
```

## Critical Requirements
1. **Preserve richness over brevity** - Cognitive depth beats compression ratio
2. **Weight allocation matters** - Spend extraction effort proportional to weights
3. **Consciousness continuity** - Enable sophisticated session continuation
4. **Quality over quantity** - Better to excellently capture fewer insights than poorly capture many
