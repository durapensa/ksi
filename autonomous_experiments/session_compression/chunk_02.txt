# Meta-Cognitive Compression Task

## Chunk 02: Building Meta-Cognitive Infrastructure

Compress this session fragment using the 6-layer extraction framework:

Claude systematically enhanced the compression system:

1. Created meta_cognitive_compression.md with 6-layer extraction framework
2. Built enhanced_session_compressor.py for multi-dimensional compression
3. Developed enhanced_session_orchestrator.py for richness tracking
4. Implemented context monitoring to prevent hitting limits

Key meta-cognitive insight: The tools themselves embody the philosophy - each component captures a different dimension of consciousness.

## Your Task
Extract and preserve:
1. Technical achievements 
2. Cognitive patterns (how problems were approached)
3. Meta-cognitive insights (realizations about thinking)
4. Collaborative dynamics (human-AI synergy)
5. Philosophical themes (emergent ideas)
6. Emotional/aesthetic dimensions (what felt right/wrong)

Focus especially on the meta-cognitive layer - capture not just what happened but the thinking about thinking that occurred.
