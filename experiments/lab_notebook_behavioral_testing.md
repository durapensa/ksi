# Lab Notebook: Behavioral Component Testing
*Started: 2025-01-28*

## Objective
Systematically test and understand how behavioral components affect agent behavior, building toward autonomous component improvement capabilities.

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Completion System Validation

#### Test 1: Basic completion:async functionality
- **Component**: `core/base_agent`
- **Test**: Simple calculation prompt
- **Result**: Agent returned full component description instead of calculation
- **Learning**: Base agent without behavioral overrides acts like a helpful assistant

#### Test 2: Claude Code Override Behavior
- **Component**: `behaviors/core/claude_code_override`
- **Test**: "Calculate: 2 + 2"
- **Result**: Direct response "4" - no explanation
- **Learning**: Override shifts from assistant mode to direct execution mode

#### Test 3: Session Continuity
- **Component**: `behaviors/core/claude_code_override`
- **Test Sequence**:
  1. "Remember this number: 42"
  2. "What number did I ask you to remember?"
- **Results**: 
  1. "I'll remember that number: 42."
  2. "42"
- **Learning**: Session continuity works - agents maintain conversation state across requests

#### Test 4: KSI Tool Use Pattern
- **Component**: `agents/tool_use_test_agent`
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `behaviors/core/claude_code_override`
  - `behaviors/communication/ksi_events_as_tool_calls`
- **Test**: "Initialize yourself and demonstrate tool use pattern"
- **Result**: Agent emitted 5 JSON events using KSI tool use format
- **Events Created**:
  - `test_entity_1738057200` (test_data)
  - `test_result_batch_001` (test_result)
- **Learning**: KSI tool use pattern enables reliable JSON event emission

### Phase 2: Behavioral Component Architecture

#### Key Discoveries

1. **Component Independence**:
   - `behaviors/core/claude_code_override` - No dependencies
   - `behaviors/communication/ksi_events_as_tool_calls` - No dependencies
   - These are orthogonal behaviors that can be combined

2. **Component Composition**:
   - `agents/tool_use_test_agent` combines both behaviors via dependencies
   - Evaluation certifies components work WITH their exact dependencies
   - Not tested in isolation, but as a complete combination

3. **Immediate Response Behavior**:
   - Agent with only `claude_code_override` responds immediately
   - This is expected - the override removes "waiting for instructions" behavior
   - Production agents combine this with other components that provide structure

### Phase 3: Test Patterns Developed

#### Test Files Created:
1. `test_json_emission_comprehensive.py` - Consolidated JSON emission testing
2. `test_behavioral_components_systematic.py` - Systematic component testing
3. `test_component_behavior_direct.py` - Direct behavioral testing
4. `test_behavioral_chain.py` - Dependency chain validation

#### Testing Methodology:
1. Test base components in isolation
2. Test behavioral modifiers separately  
3. Test composed agents with full dependency chains
4. Verify event emissions match expectations

### Next Steps

1. **Build Evaluation Test Suites**:
   - Create evaluations that certify behavioral effectiveness
   - Test that components work correctly with dependencies
   - Validate event emission patterns

2. **Simple Component Improver Agent**:
   - Agent that can read component files
   - Analyze component effectiveness
   - Suggest improvements (starting with token reduction)
   - Use evaluation:run to validate improvements

3. **Behavioral Component Library**:
   - Document discovered patterns
   - Create reusable behavioral mixins
   - Build complexity incrementally

## Technical Notes

### KSI Tool Use Pattern
The most reliable JSON emission pattern discovered:
```json
{
  "type": "ksi_tool_use",
  "id": "ksiu_[purpose]_[seq]",
  "name": "[event_name]",
  "input": {
    // event parameters
  }
}
```

This leverages LLMs' native tool-calling abilities for consistent JSON extraction.

### Behavioral Override Effect
`claude_code_override` fundamentally shifts agent behavior:
- Removes explanatory preambles
- Eliminates permission-seeking
- Focuses on direct task execution
- Must be combined with task-specific instructions

### Session Management
- Each agent gets a persistent `sandbox_uuid`
- Claude CLI maintains sessions by working directory
- Enables conversation continuity across completion:async calls
- Critical for iterative improvement workflows

## Observations

1. **Component Isolation**: Behavioral components truly are modular - they can be tested in isolation and combined predictably.

2. **Event Emission Reliability**: The KSI tool use pattern provides near-100% reliability for JSON event emission, solving a critical challenge.

3. **Evaluation Importance**: Components must be evaluated WITH their dependencies, not in isolation. This ensures the complete system works as intended.

4. **Incremental Complexity**: Starting with simple behaviors (override, tool use) and building up to complex agents is the right approach.
