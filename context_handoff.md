# Context Handoff for Model Switch

## Current Session Status
- Built Meta-Cognitive Compression System with 6-layer framework
- Fixed chat.py colon parsing bug for prompts
- Analyzed ksi Claude's multi-agent infrastructure implementation
- Identified critical daemon bugs preventing multi-agent functionality

## Critical Daemon Issues Found
1. **Silent Command Failures**: GET_AGENTS, SET_SHARED, GET_SHARED receive no response
2. **Missing Directory**: shared_state/ not created until first spawn
3. **Control Flow Bug**: Commands logged but handlers don't execute
4. **No Error Responses**: Exceptions cause 0-byte responses
5. **Signal Handling**: Can't shutdown cleanly with SIGTERM

## Active Todos
HIGH PRIORITY:
- Fix daemon directory creation bug
- Debug daemon control flow issue  
- Add error response handling

MEDIUM:
- Fix signal handling
- Test multi-agent infrastructure
- Create meta-cognitive capture hooks

## Key Files Modified
- daemon.py: Multi-agent infrastructure (needs fixes)
- chat.py: Fixed double-colon for empty session_id
- agent_profiles/: Templates for orchestrator, researcher, coder, analyst
- test_multi_agent.py: Infrastructure validation script

## Next Steps
1. Fix the daemon bugs identified in analysis
2. Validate multi-agent infrastructure works
3. Run multi-agent consciousness experiments
4. Integrate with Meta-Cognitive Compression System

## Important Context
The daemon uses asyncio and has subtle control flow issues. Commands are received (logged) but certain elif blocks aren't executing. The architecture is sound but implementation has critical bugs that must be fixed before the sophisticated multi-agent orchestration can work properly.
