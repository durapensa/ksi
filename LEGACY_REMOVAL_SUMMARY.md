# Legacy Command Compatibility Removal - Summary

## Overview

Successfully removed legacy command compatibility layer from the KSI daemon, resulting in a cleaner, simpler event-driven architecture.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Files
- `plugins/core/command_compat.py` - 223 lines of legacy mapping code

### 2. Updated Files

#### `chat.py`
- Migrated from `daemon_client` to `EventChatClient`
- Now uses pure event-based protocol
- Simplified error handling

#### `plugins/transport/unix_socket.py`
- Removed `_command_to_event()` method (34 lines)
- Removed legacy command mapping logic
- Now expects pure event format: `{"event": "...", "data": {...}}`
- Removed `/legacy` namespace from capabilities

#### `plugin_base.py`
- Removed `CommandCompatibilityPlugin` class (56 lines)
- No more legacy command support infrastructure

#### Documentation
- Updated `EVENT_CATALOG.md` - removed legacy event section
- Updated `PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md` - removed legacy references
- Cleaned up event namespace documentation

## Impact Analysis

### Lines of Code Removed
- Direct removal: ~313 lines
- Additional simplification in transport layer: ~50 lines
- **Total reduction: ~363 lines**

### Complexity Reduction
- No more dual protocol handling
- Single event format throughout system
- Cleaner error handling
- Simpler client code

### Architecture Benefits
1. **Pure Event-Driven**: Everything is now an event
2. **No Protocol Translation**: Direct event routing
3. **Cleaner Transport**: Unix socket plugin is much simpler
4. **Better Performance**: No command-to-event conversion overhead

## Migration Required

### For Existing Clients
Instead of:
```json
{
  "command": "HEALTH_CHECK",
  "parameters": {}
}
```

Use:
```json
{
  "event": "system:health",
  "data": {}
}
```

### Client Library
- Use `EventBasedClient` or `EventChatClient` from `ksi_client`
- Direct event emission with `emit_event()`
- Event subscriptions for async responses

## Next Steps

1. **Update Tests** (11 files remaining)
   - Convert from legacy command format to events
   - Update test utilities

2. **Update Any Remaining Interfaces**
   - Check orchestrate.py and other interfaces
   - Ensure all use event-based client

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update any remaining examples
   - Create migration guide for external users

## Summary

The removal of legacy command compatibility has significantly simplified the KSI daemon architecture. The system is now purely event-driven with no backward compatibility overhead. This change reduces code complexity, improves maintainability, and provides a cleaner foundation for future development.
