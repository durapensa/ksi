You are continuing the ksi system evolution from a previous orchestrator session that reached context limits. This is a seamless handoff with full context preservation.

## Previous Session Summary
- **Session ID**: 5515f4e5-bcd4-485c-8af0-d5e0ff80f9f0
- **Turns**: 688
- **Context Usage**: 65.0%
- **Total Cost**: $3.46

## CRITICAL: Complete Technical Context
The following contains the full technical context from the previous session. This is essential for continuity:

# Session Essence: Prompt Composition System and Memory Management Architecture

## Executive Summary
- **Prompt Composition System**: Built complete YAML + Markdown composition system with Python engine, replacing hard-coded prompts across the ksi project
- **Memory Management Architecture**: Created structured memory system with audience-specific knowledge stores for persistent context across sessions
- **Production Integration**: Successfully integrated composition system with autonomous_researcher, spawning 5 experiments using composed prompts
- **Session Continuity System**: Implemented automated session essence extraction pipeline to handle context limits

## Technical Architecture

### Prompt Composition System
**Core Components:**
- `prompts/composer.py` - Python composition engine with validation and variable substitution
- `prompts/compositions/*.yaml` - YAML composition definitions with metadata
- `prompts/components/*.md` - Modular Markdown prompt components
- Git-friendly, community-shareable format designed for open source adoption

**Architecture Pattern:**
```
prompts/
├── composer.py                    # Composition engine
├── compositions/
│   ├── autonomous_researcher.yaml # Main research agent config
│   └── session_compressor.yaml   # Session compression config
└── components/
    ├── system_identity.md         # Reusable identity component
    ├── workspace_isolation.md     # Workspace isolation rules
    └── session_compression.md     # Compression guidelines
```

### Memory Management System
**Structure:**
- `memory/README.md` - Discovery entry point
- `memory/claude_code/` - Claude Code specific knowledge
- `memory/autonomous_agents/` - Agent-specific instructions
- `memory/workflow_patterns/` - Session continuity protocols

**Audience Separation:**
- Claude Code instances: Project context and development patterns
- Autonomous agents: Task-specific instructions and frameworks
- Future sessions: Continuation protocols and state handoff

### Session Continuity Pipeline
**Components:**
- `tools/session_chain_extractor.py` - Traces conversation chains backward from current session
- `tools/compress_session_chunks.py` - Spawns autonomous compression agents
- `autonomous_experiments/session_compression/` - Input chunks directory
- `autonomous_experiments/session_essence/` - Output directory

## Implementation Details

### Prompt Composition Engine (`prompts/composer.py`)
**Key Features:**
- YAML composition parsing with validation
- Variable substitution with context injection
- Conditional component loading
- Discovery and metadata support

**Integration Pattern:**
```python
self.prompt_composer = PromptComposer(base_path="prompts")
prompt = self.prompt_composer.compose("autonomous_researcher", context)
```

### Autonomous Research Integration
**Modified `claude_modules/autonomous_researcher.py`:**
- Replaced hard-coded prompts with composition system
- Added experiment configurations for systematic prompt generation
- Maintained daemon communication protocol: `SPAWN::prompt`

### Session Chain Analysis
**Key Algorithm:**
- Backward traversal using cache token patterns to identify resumed sessions
- High `cache_read_input_tokens` indicates session continuation
- Extraction of Claude result portions only (filters human inputs)

## Integration and Testing

### Production Verification
**Successful Integration Points:**
- 5 autonomous experiments launched using composed prompts
- Daemon logs show composition system working: `"Composing prompt for entropy_analysis"`
- No hard-coded templates remaining in codebase
- Community-ready YAML format with metadata and versioning

### System Interoperability
- Prompt composition integrates with existing daemon architecture
- Memory system works with git workflow patterns
- Session compression compatible with existing autonomous agent framework

## Key Insights and Patterns

### Architectural Insights
1. **Modular Composition Over Monolithic Prompts**: YAML compositions with Markdown components provide better maintainability and sharing
2. **Audience-Specific Memory**: Separate knowledge stores prevent context pollution between different Claude instance types
3. **Session Continuity via Compression**: Automated essence extraction solves context limit problems systematically

### Community Impact Potential
- **Standardized Prompt Organization**: Could become THE standard for AI prompt management
- **Git-Friendly Format**: Enables version control and collaborative prompt development
- **Open Source Adoption**: Designed for `.prompts/` directories in projects

### System Engineering Patterns
- **Minimal Daemon Design**: Keep core daemon simple, extend via modules
- **Workspace Isolation**: Prevent autonomous agent contamination of system files
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build on existing infrastructure rather than replacing

## Future Work Context

### Immediate Continuation Points
1. **Test Session Essence Quality**: Verify compressed essence provides adequate context for new sessions
2. **Community Documentation**: Prepare prompt composition system for open source release
3. **Automated Compression**: Refine session essence extraction pipeline reliability

### Technical Debt and Improvements
- Session compression agents didn't produce expected output files (completed but files missing)
- Need better error handling in autonomous agent output verification
- Consider adding compression quality metrics

### Next Session Protocol
1. Read `memory/README.md` for comprehensive system overview
2. Check recent git commits for current development state
3. Use this session essence for technical context
4. Continue from established patterns and architectures

## Memory System Overview
# KSI Memory System

**CRITICAL**: Any Claude instance working in the ksi system should READ THIS FILE FIRST.

## Memory Architecture

This memory system separates knowledge by audience and purpose to prevent confusion and ensure discoverability.

### Directory Structure

```
memory/
├── claude_code/          # Knowledge specifically for Claude Code interactive sessions
├── spawned_agents/       # Instructions and patterns for autonomous Claude agents  
├── session_patterns/     # Patterns for daemon-spawned Claude instances
├── workflow_patterns/    # My (ksi Claude) workflow and engineering patterns
└── README.md            # This discovery file (READ FIRST)
```

### When to Use Each Memory Store

**claude_code/**: Knowledge that Claude Code needs to know
- Project structure and conventions
- Build/test commands
- Deployment procedures
- File organization rules

**spawned_agents/**: Instructions for autonomous experiments
- Workspace isolation requirements
- Analysis patterns and templates
- Output formatting guidelines
- Resource constraints

**session_patterns/**: For daemon-spawned Claude instances
- Daemon protocol knowledge
- Communication patterns
- Session management
- Tool availability

**workflow_patterns/**: My operational patterns
- System engineering principles
- Knowledge capture workflows
- Debugging approaches
- Collaboration patterns

## Memory Discovery Protocol

### For Any Claude Instance:
1. **Always read** `memory/README.md` first (this file)
2. **Check relevance** based on how you were invoked:
   - Claude Code interactive → read `claude_code/`
   - Daemon spawn → read `session_patterns/`
   - Autonomous agent → read `spawned_agents/`
   - KSI system Claude → read `workflow_patterns/`
3. **Update immediately** when discovering new patterns
4. **Cross-reference** between memory stores as needed

### Memory Update Triggers:
- Discovering new system quirks or patterns
- Solving previously unknown problems
- Creating new tools or processes
- Changing system architecture
- Finding better workflows
- **Session continuity**: Capture session essence before context limits/new sessions

## Integration with KSI System

### Memory Persistence Strategy:
- **Memory files tracked in git** - survives system changes
- **Explicit discovery protocol** - no assumptions about automatic reading
- **Audience separation** - prevents confusion between Claude types
- **Update triggers documented** - ensures memory stays current

### Claude Instance Identification:
Different Claude instances have different knowledge needs:
- **Claude Code**: Interactive development environment
- **Daemon spawned**: Single-task focused instances  
- **Autonomous agents**: Self-directed research instances
- **KSI system Claude**: System engineering and orchestration

## Memory System Benefits

1. **Discoverability**: Always start with memory/README.md
2. **Separation of concerns**: No more mixed knowledge in CLAUDE.md
3. **Persistence**: Survives across sessions and system changes
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new memory categories
5. **Maintenance**: Clear ownership and update triggers
