# Critical Issues in Multi-Agent Infrastructure

## Confirmed Bugs

### 1. Missing Directory Creation
- `shared_state/` not created until first spawn
- `SET_SHARED` fails with FileNotFoundError if called first
- Silent failure - no error response sent to client

### 2. Control Flow Issues
Commands are received (logged) but responses aren't sent for:
- GET_AGENTS
- SET_SHARED
- GET_SHARED

### 3. Potential Root Cause
After deep analysis, the issue appears to be that these command handlers are not being reached at all. Despite the logs showing "Received command: GET_AGENTS...", the actual handler code isn't executing.

This suggests a subtle bug in the control flow structure where:
1. The command is logged at line 491
2. But the specific elif blocks aren't being entered
3. No else block catches unhandled commands
4. Connection closes without response

## Fix Required

1. **Immediate**: Add directory creation to daemon startup
2. **Critical**: Debug why elif blocks aren't executing for these commands
3. **Important**: Add else block to catch unhandled commands
4. **Essential**: Ensure all exceptions send error responses

## Test Results
- SPAWN: ✅ Works (creates directories first)
- GET_AGENTS: ❌ No response
- SET_SHARED: ❌ No response, no file created
- GET_SHARED: ❌ No response

The infrastructure has great design but needs these critical fixes before use.
