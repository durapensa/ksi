# KSI Tool Use Investigation - Root Cause Analysis

## Executive Summary

Investigation into why agents cannot emit KSI tool use events revealed a **system-level issue**: The Claude CLI is hanging/not responding, preventing the completion service from processing any prompts.

## Investigation Findings

### 1. KSI Tool Use Extraction IS Implemented ✅

**Evidence Found:**
- `/Users/dp/projects/ksi/ksi_daemon/completion/extract_ksi_tool_use.py` - Full extraction implementation
- `/Users/dp/projects/ksi/ksi_common/json_extraction.py` - Dual-path extraction (legacy + tool use)
- `/Users/dp/projects/ksi/ksi_common/tool_use_adapter.py` - Format conversion logic

**The extraction pipeline:**
1. Completion service receives response text
2. `extract_and_emit_json_events()` is called  
3. Dual-path extraction handles both formats:
   - Legacy: `{"event": "...", "data": {...}}`
   - Tool use: `{"type": "ksi_tool_use", "id": "...", "name": "...", "input": {...}}`
4. Events are emitted via event_emitter
5. Results route back to originator via `route_to_originator()`

### 2. Components Are Correctly Configured ✅

**Agent Components Include:**
- `behaviors/communication/ksi_events_as_tool_calls` - Defines the format
- `behaviors/core/claude_code_override` - Behavioral overrides
- Proper dependencies and capabilities

### 3. The Actual Problem: Claude CLI Hanging ❌

**Test Results:**
```bash
# Completion service status
Active completions: 26
Failed: 24
Completed: 3

# Direct CLI test
~/.claude/local/claude -p "Say hello"
# Command timed out after 2m 0.0s
```

**Root Cause:**
- Claude CLI is not responding to requests
- Completions queue up but never process
- No responses means no JSON to extract
- Agents exist but can't communicate

## Why Agent Orchestration Appeared to Work

In earlier tests, the game_theory_orchestrator DID spawn pd_player_1 and pd_player_2. This worked because:
1. Agent spawning doesn't require completion responses
2. The spawn event is handled directly by agent service
3. Only the initial prompt (requiring completion) failed

## The Architecture vs Execution Gap

### What's Working:
- ✅ Event routing architecture
- ✅ JSON extraction pipeline  
- ✅ Agent spawning mechanism
- ✅ State management
- ✅ Capability system

### What's Broken:
- ❌ Claude CLI not responding
- ❌ Completion service can't get responses
- ❌ No responses = no JSON to extract
- ❌ Agents can't emit events

## Impact on Agent-Directed Orchestration

**Current State:**
```
Agent receives prompt → Completion queued → Claude CLI hangs → No response
                                                                ↓
                                                         No JSON extraction
                                                                ↓
                                                         No event emission
                                                                ↓
                                                         No orchestration
```

**Expected State:**
```
Agent receives prompt → Completion processed → Response with JSON
                                                        ↓
                                                 JSON extracted
                                                        ↓
                                                 Events emitted
                                                        ↓
                                                 Orchestration works
```

## No Workarounds Philosophy

Following the "no workarounds" philosophy, the fixes needed are:

### System Level:
1. **Fix Claude CLI** - Ensure it responds to requests
2. **Add timeout handling** - Detect and handle hanging requests
3. **Implement fallback provider** - Use LiteLLM when Claude CLI fails

### KSI Level (once CLI works):
1. **Verify extraction** - Ensure JSON is properly extracted
2. **Add extraction logging** - Better visibility into what's extracted
3. **Test event emission** - Confirm events are emitted correctly

## Test Scripts Created

1. **test_ksi_tool_use.py** - Tests direct event emission
2. **debug_completion.py** - Isolated completion service testing
3. **test_agent_orchestration.py** - Full orchestration validation
4. **agent_directed_game_theory.py** - Real orchestrator implementation

## Conclusion

**The investigation revealed that KSI's architecture for agent-directed orchestration is sound**, with proper:
- Event extraction implementation
- Routing mechanisms
- Component structure
- Capability management

**However, execution is blocked by a system-level issue**: Claude CLI is not responding, preventing any completion processing.

**This is NOT a workaround situation** - this is a prerequisite failure. The system cannot function without a working LLM provider.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix Claude CLI installation/configuration
2. **Short-term**: Add provider health checks and failover
3. **Then**: Validate KSI tool use extraction with working provider
4. **Finally**: Achieve true agent-directed orchestration
