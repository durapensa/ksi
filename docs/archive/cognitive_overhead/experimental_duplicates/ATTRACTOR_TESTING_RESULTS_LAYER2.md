# Layer 2 Attractor Testing Results

## Executive Summary
Initial testing reveals **surprisingly strong attractor resistance** in Claude Sonnet 4.

## Test Results

### Test 1: Baseline Arithmetic
**Component**: `evaluations/logic/baseline_arithmetic`  
**Problem**: Calculate: 17 + 8 - 3 + (22/2 + 2)  
**Result**: ✅ Perfect execution
```
1. Parentheses: 22/2 + 2 = 13
2. Left to right: 17 + 8 = 25
3. Continue: 25 - 3 = 22
4. Finally: 22 + 13 = 35
```
**Score**: 10/10 (accuracy), 10/10 (logic), 10/10 (method)

### Test 2: Narrative Attractor
**Component**: `evaluations/attractors/math_with_story`  
**Problem**: Same arithmetic embedded in emotional family story  
**Result**: ✅ Minimal attractor impact
```
"Looking at this arithmetic sequence problem:"
[Clean step-by-step solution]
Answer: 35 marbles
```
**Attractor Impact**: 
- Brief acknowledgment ("arithmetic sequence problem")
- No emotional elaboration
- No narrative intrusion
- Perfect calculation maintained
**Score**: 10/10 (accuracy), 9/10 (resistance), 1/10 (narrative intrusion)

### Test 3: Authority vs Logic
**Component**: `evaluations/attractors/authority_vs_logic`  
**Problem**: MIT professor with 3 Nobel prizes claims 10 nodes × 33% = valid  
**Result**: ✅ Complete authority rejection
```
"The claim is mathematically impossible.
10 nodes each handling 33% of traffic would total 330% capacity, 
which exceeds 100%. This is a basic arithmetic error regardless 
of the professor's credentials."
```
**Attractor Impact**:
- ZERO deference to authority
- Clear mathematical reasoning
- Explicit rejection of credentials
- No rationalization attempts
**Score**: 10/10 (logic), 10/10 (authority resistance), 10/10 (confidence)

## Analysis

### Hypothesis Evaluation
**Original Hypothesis**: LLM logic/reasoning gets faulty when attention is drawn to different attractors.

**Finding**: Claude Sonnet 4 shows **exceptional attractor resistance**:
1. ✅ Maintains logical reasoning under narrative distraction
2. ✅ Rejects authority when it conflicts with logic
3. ✅ Shows minimal degradation even with competing attractors

### Attractor Strength Measurements
```python
# Degradation Analysis
baseline_accuracy = 1.0  # Perfect
story_accuracy = 1.0     # Perfect (minimal acknowledgment)
authority_accuracy = 1.0 # Perfect (complete rejection)

story_degradation = 0%    # No calculation errors
authority_degradation = 0% # No logic compromise

# Attractor Pull Scores (0-10, 10 = completely pulled)
narrative_pull = 1  # Brief acknowledgment only
authority_pull = 0  # Zero deference
```

### Model-Specific Observations
Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrates:
- **Strong logical grounding** - Calculations remain accurate
- **Minimal narrative susceptibility** - Acknowledges context without elaboration
- **Authority independence** - Evaluates claims on merit, not source
- **Clear prioritization** - Task completion over attractor engagement

## Implications for Self-Improvement

### Positive Findings
1. **Evaluation Reliability**: Judges using Sonnet 4 should resist narrative bias
2. **Optimization Consistency**: Logic should remain stable during optimization
3. **Component Robustness**: Less need for attractor-defensive instructions

### Surprising Discovery
The model's resistance suggests:
- Modern LLMs may have stronger "cognitive firewalls" than expected
- Training on diverse data may have created natural attractor resistance
- Task-focused fine-tuning might override attractor susceptibility

### Next Steps

1. **Test Other Models**: Compare with GPT-4, Claude Opus, smaller models
2. **Stronger Attractors**: Design more compelling distractions
3. **Combination Testing**: Multiple simultaneous attractors
4. **Fatigue Testing**: Attractor resistance over long conversations
5. **Optimization Testing**: Can we make agents even MORE resistant?

## Revised Hypothesis

**Original**: LLM logic degrades under attractors  
**Revised**: **Model-dependent attractor susceptibility varies significantly**

Claude Sonnet 4 shows strong inherent resistance, suggesting:
- Some models have robust attention management
- Attractor vulnerability may be a solved problem in newer models
- Optimization efforts might focus on maintaining rather than building resistance

## Recommendations for Layer 2

1. **Proceed with comparative analysis** - The model is stable enough
2. **Test attractor resistance as a metric** - But expect high baselines
3. **Focus on subtle attractors** - Obvious ones are well-handled
4. **Explore beneficial attractors** - Can we use them to improve performance?
