# Pythonic Context Refactor Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic refactoring of KSI's event context system to implement the Pythonic Context Design with reference-based storage, dual-path persistence, and minimal redundancy.

**Status**: Implementation Phase  
**Complexity**: High - Touches core event system  
**Breaking Changes**: Yes - Internal architecture change

## Goals

1. **Implement Python contextvars** for automatic context propagation
2. **Create reference-based storage** to eliminate duplication (66% size reduction)
3. **Build two-tier architecture**: Hot (memory) + Cold (SQLite)
4. **Remove ALL old/dead/fallback code** while preserving intended functionality
5. **Ensure zero data loss** with immediate async persistence

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have Now
- Events contain full `_ksi_context` in JSON (728 bytes average)
- JSONL files store complete events with embedded contexts
- No context deduplication across events
- Session management is scattered
- Some modules may still use old metadata patterns (see [EVENT_CONTEXT_SIMPLIFICATION.md](./EVENT_CONTEXT_SIMPLIFICATION.md))

### What We're Building
- Events contain context reference only (248 bytes average) - 66% reduction
- Separate Context DB with full metadata (see [Storage Architecture](./PYTHONIC_CONTEXT_DESIGN.md#complete-storage-architecture-minimal-redundancy))
- Hot path: Pure in-memory for 24 hours
- Cold path: SQLite for everything (7-30 day retention)
- Automatic context propagation via Python's async internals (see [Design](./PYTHONIC_CONTEXT_DESIGN.md#pythonic-context-management))

## Implementation Phases

## Dead Code to Remove

Per [BREAKING CHANGE philosophy](../CLAUDE.md#breaking-change-philosophy), we remove ALL backward compatibility and dead code.

### Confirmed Removal Targets
1. **Flat metadata access patterns**
   ```python
   # OLD - Remove all instances
   event.get('_event_id')
   data._correlation_id
   raw_data['_agent_id']
   ```

2. **Backward compatibility in monitor.py**
   ```python
   # Remove any code that adds flat fields for compatibility
   if "_ksi_context" in event_data:
       # Any flattening code here
   ```

3. **Old session management**
   - Direct session_id handling outside context
   - Separate session tracking code
   - Session compatibility layers

4. **Legacy event handlers**
   - Handlers using `raw_data` parameter
   - Direct metadata field access
   - Old event format expectations

### Code Patterns to Preserve
1. **Business logic** - All event handlers' core functionality
2. **External APIs** - Public interfaces remain stable
3. **Component system** - No changes to composition
4. **MCP integration** - Preserve all integrations

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Context manager isolation tests
- [ ] Storage backend tests
- [ ] Reference generation tests
- [ ] Query performance tests

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Event flow with references
- [ ] Context propagation across handlers
- [ ] Cross-process context continuity
- [ ] Hot/cold storage transitions

### System Tests
- [ ] Full daemon operation
- [ ] Multi-agent orchestrations
- [ ] Long-running optimizations
- [ ] Crash recovery scenarios

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Event throughput comparison
- [ ] Memory usage reduction
- [ ] Query latency benchmarks
- [ ] Storage size validation

## Rollback Plan

1. **Feature flags** for gradual rollout
2. **Parallel operation** during transition
3. **Data export** before migration
4. **Version tagging** for quick revert

## Success Metrics

- [ ] 66% reduction in event storage size
- [ ] Sub-millisecond hot path latency
- [ ] Zero data loss in crash scenarios
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No functional regressions

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Breaking Event Flow
**Mitigation**: Extensive testing, gradual rollout

### Risk 2: Performance Degradation
**Mitigation**: Benchmark before/after, hot path optimization

### Risk 3: Data Loss
**Mitigation**: Dual-path persistence, immediate SQLite writes

### Risk 4: Complex Migration
**Mitigation**: Incremental changes, backward compatibility during transition

## Key Concepts Consolidation

### From PYTHONIC_CONTEXT_DESIGN.md
- **Reference Architecture**: Store context once, reference everywhere
- **Two-Tier Storage**: Hot (memory) + Cold (SQLite), no warm tier
- **Dual-Path Pattern**: Sync to memory, async to SQLite
- **Context Database**: Includes session data, no separate session DB

### From EVENT_CONTEXT_SIMPLIFICATION.md  
- **Unified Metadata**: All system fields in `_ksi_context`
- **No Flat Fields**: Remove `_event_id`, `_correlation_id` at root
- **Handler Updates**: Use `data` parameter, not `raw_data`

### From CLAUDE.md
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: No backward compatibility in internals
- **Investigation First**: Fix root causes, never workaround
- **Complete Tasks**: Code + Test + Deploy + Verify

### Storage Decisions
- **No Redis**: SQLite is sufficient for our latency requirements
- **No Response DB**: JSONL files + references only
- **No Session DB**: Embedded in context data
- **Simple Design**: Minimum viable databases

## Implementation Notes

- Start with read-only operations to minimize risk
- Keep old system running in parallel initially
- Monitor performance metrics closely
- Document all removed code patterns
- Ensure BREAKING CHANGE compliance throughout
- Reference design docs for architectural decisions
- Test each phase thoroughly before proceeding
