| Niche topic | Example Sonnet 4 task & why it matters |
| ----- | ----- |
| Single-cell multi-omics integration | Automates joint analysis of scRNA-seq \+ scATAC-seq data sets, surfacing new regulatory links in minutes.  |
| Wet-lab cloning / CRISPR protocol drafting | Writes detailed cloning procedures that blind tests found on par with 5-year expert plans.  |
| Wearable bioinformatics pipelines | Crunches weeks-long wearable-sensor analyses in \< 1 hour, unlocking faster health-insight loops.  |
| Biomedical literature triage & hypothesis generation | FutureHouse agents use Claude to scan millions of papers, rank evidence, and propose testable ideas for biologists.  |
| Multi-agent research orchestration | Anthropic’s own system pairs an Opus lead with Sonnet 4 sub-agents, boosting breadth-first research accuracy by \~90 %.  |
| Autonomous desktop / GUI control | The **computer-use** tool lets Sonnet 4 “see” the screen, move the mouse/keyboard, and automate full desktop workflows.  |
| Cross-file debugging for complex systems | Community devs report Sonnet 4 creating scripts that trace bugs across multiple files & dependencies, avoiding tunnel-vision fixes.  |
| Large-codebase refactor planning | 64 K-token output \+ lifecycle guidance help it plan and execute multi-file refactors end-to-end.  |
| Quantum-circuit coding for real hardware | Users have prompted Sonnet-family models to generate and run superconducting-qubit circuits on the Starmon-7 backend.  |
| Quantum-chemistry DSL synthesis | Researchers are training LLMs to emit ORCA input files; Sonnet 4’s long context & code reasoning make it a natural fit.  |
| Visible extended-thinking mode | Devs can allocate a “thinking budget,” letting Sonnet 4 reveal chain-of-thought and spend extra compute on thorny problems.   |
