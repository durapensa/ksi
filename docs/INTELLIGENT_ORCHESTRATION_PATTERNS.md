# Intelligent Orchestration Patterns

A hybrid approach to multi-agent orchestration combining intelligent agents with shareable declarative patterns.

## Overview

Intelligent agents (like Claude) act as orchestration engines that adapt dynamically while learning and sharing successful patterns with other orchestrators.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Orchestration IS Communication** - LLMs excel at agent coordination
2. **Patterns ARE Instructions** - Natural language strategies, not rigid code
3. **Adaptation IS Intelligence** - Dynamic strategy changes based on results
4. **Learning IS Sharing** - Successful patterns evolve and spread
5. **Loose Coupling IS Strength** - Event-driven architecture enables flexibility

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Universal Event Emission** (`event:emit`) - Enables DSL implementation without tight coupling
2. **Pattern Evolution System** - Fork/merge/diff operations with lineage tracking  
3. **Orchestration Primitives** - Minimal set of powerful coordination tools
4. **Event Transformers** - Generic system for event transformation without duplication

### Pattern Management

Orchestration patterns stored in `var/lib/compositions/orchestrations/` with decision tracking in `*_decisions.yaml` files.

**Pattern Operations:**
- `composition:fork/merge/diff` - Evolution with lineage
- `composition:track_decision` - Learning from experience
- `composition:discover/select` - Intelligent pattern choice

**Base Orchestrator Profile:**
- Extends `base_multi_agent` with pattern awareness
- Interprets natural language DSL via `event:emit`
- Tracks decisions for continuous improvement

## Pattern Format

Orchestration patterns include:
- **Metadata**: Version, lineage, performance metrics
- **DSL Strategy**: Natural language mixed with structured operations
- **Learnings**: Documented insights with confidence scores
- **Decision History**: Tracked adaptations and outcomes

## Pattern Evolution Workflow

1. **Discovery**: Find patterns via `composition:discover` with performance filters
2. **Selection**: Choose best pattern via `composition:select` based on task requirements
3. **Interpretation**: Execute DSL strategies using `event:emit`
4. **Tracking**: Record decisions and outcomes via `composition:track_decision`
5. **Evolution**: Fork successful adaptations when performance improves
6. **Learning**: Document insights in pattern metadata and decision logs

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Universal event emission via `event:emit`
- Pattern evolution events: fork, merge, diff, track_decision
- Self-contained pattern storage with decision tracking

### ✅ Phase 2: Pattern-Aware Orchestrators
- Base orchestrator profile with pattern operations
- Example patterns: adaptive_tournament_v2, distributed_analysis
- Dual decision tracking: inline learnings + detailed logs

### ✅ Phase 3: Orchestration Primitives
All primitives implemented in `ksi_daemon/orchestration/orchestration_primitives.py`:

**Core Set (7):**
- `orchestration:spawn` - Agent creation with context
- `orchestration:send` - Flexible message targeting
- `orchestration:await` - Conditional response collection
- `orchestration:track` - Universal data recording
- `orchestration:query` - State introspection
- `orchestration:coordinate` - Synchronization patterns
- `orchestration:aggregate` - Statistical, voting, and consensus aggregation

#### orchestration:aggregate

A powerful primitive for aggregating data from multiple agents with various methods:
- **vote**: Majority, plurality, ranked choice voting
- **statistical**: Mean, median, trimmed mean with confidence intervals
- **consensus**: Weighted averaging based on reputation/confidence
- **custom**: User-provided aggregation functions

Supports grouping, filtering, and flexible data extraction from complex responses.

#### Design Philosophy

1. **Parameters over Primitives**: One flexible primitive with rich parameters beats 5 specific ones
2. **Composition over Prescription**: Orchestrators build complex behaviors from simple parts
3. **Context over Control**: Rich metadata and context, not rigid workflows
4. **General over Specific**: "track anything" instead of track_metrics, track_decisions, etc.

#### Orchestration Context

All primitives maintain orchestration context with pattern, orchestrator_id, execution_id, and metadata for tracking and coordination.

### Event-Driven DSL

The DSL is interpreted by orchestrators using event:emit. Natural language strategies are mixed with structured operations, allowing orchestrators to adapt implementation based on context.

### Integration Patterns

Modules can optionally enhance the system without tight coupling. For example, evaluation modules might listen for pattern forks to run comparisons, or monitoring modules might track decision metrics.

## Benefits of This Architecture

### Loose Coupling
- Modules don't import each other
- Orchestrators use event:emit for all coordination
- Patterns work regardless of which modules are loaded

### Self-Contained Evolution
- All pattern data stored in composition files
- Decision history tracked alongside patterns
- No external dependencies for pattern management

### Natural for LLMs
- DSL is interpretive, not prescriptive
- Orchestrators understand intent, not just syntax
- Patterns described in natural language

### Continuous Improvement
- Every run can improve patterns
- Successful adaptations become new patterns
- Learning is preserved and shareable

## Future Directions

### Pattern Federation
- Pattern registries for sharing across KSI networks
- Reputation systems for pattern authors
- Automated pattern translation between contexts

### Advanced DSL Features
- Conditional imports: `IF complex_task: INCLUDE advanced_strategies`
- Pattern composition: `COMBINE tournament WITH pipeline`
- Meta-patterns: Patterns that evolve other patterns

### Pattern Analytics
- Automated A/B testing of pattern variants
- Performance prediction based on task characteristics
- Pattern recommendation engines

## Primitive Composition Patterns

### Common Patterns

1. **Distributed Work**: Spawn workers, intelligently route tasks, wait with partial tolerance
2. **Consensus Building**: Spawn evaluators, coordinate voting, aggregate results
3. **Cascading Analysis**: Quick analysis first, deep dive on anomalies
4. **Adaptive Pipeline**: Multi-stage processing with failure handling

### Best Practices

1. **Context Preservation**: Use consistent execution_id throughout orchestration
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Design for partial failures with fallback strategies
3. **Decision Documentation**: Track key decisions for pattern learning
4. **Efficient Coordination**: Choose appropriate synchronization types
5. **Smart Targeting**: Use criteria-based targeting to reduce overhead

## Getting Started

1. **Enable orchestration primitives** - Already included in KSI
2. **Create orchestrator agents** using base_orchestrator profile
3. **Write patterns** with natural language DSL combining primitives
4. **Track decisions** to enable pattern evolution
5. **Fork successful adaptations** to create new patterns
6. **Share patterns** with the community

The key insight: By combining intelligent agents with shareable patterns and loose coupling through events, we get adaptability, reproducibility, and continuous improvement. Orchestration becomes a collaborative learning process rather than rigid automation.
