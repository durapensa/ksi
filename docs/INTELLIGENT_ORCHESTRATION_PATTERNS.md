# Intelligent Orchestration Patterns

A hybrid approach to multi-agent orchestration that combines intelligent agents with shareable declarative patterns.

## Overview

Instead of building complex orchestration engines with rigid state machines, we use intelligent agents (like Claude) AS the orchestration engine. These orchestrators can adapt to situations dynamically while also learning and sharing successful patterns with other orchestrators.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Orchestration IS Communication**: Coordinating agents is fundamentally about communication, which LLMs excel at
2. **Patterns ARE Instructions**: We describe patterns in natural language, not code
3. **Adaptation IS Intelligence**: The ability to change strategies based on results
4. **Learning IS Sharing**: Successful patterns can be exported and shared across orchestrators

## Architecture

### Essential Orchestration Primitives

```python
# Agent Management
spawn_agent(profile, purpose, metadata) -> agent_id
terminate_agent(agent_id)
list_agents(filter_criteria) -> [agents]

# Coordination
broadcast_task(task_description, target_agents)
await_responses(agents, timeout) -> responses
delegate_subtask(agent_id, task)

# Monitoring
observe_events(patterns, callback)
query_agent_status(agent_id) -> status
track_metrics(metric_names) -> values

# Decision Making
evaluate_results(criteria) -> assessment
select_best(options, criteria) -> choice
should_continue(condition) -> bool

# Adaptation
modify_strategy(new_approach)
create_checkpoint(state)
rollback_to_checkpoint(checkpoint_id)
```

### Orchestrator Agent Profile

```yaml
name: orchestrator_agent
extends: base_agent
components:
  - name: orchestration_capabilities
    inline:
      prompt: |
        You are an orchestration agent responsible for coordinating multi-agent workflows.
        
        ORCHESTRATION PATTERNS YOU KNOW:
        1. TOURNAMENT: Competitive evaluation with matches
        2. MAP-REDUCE: Divide work, process in parallel, combine results
        3. PIPELINE: Sequential processing through stages
        4. CONSENSUS: Multiple agents evaluate independently
        5. EVOLUTIONARY: Iterative improvement through generations
        
        ADAPTIVE BEHAVIORS:
        - Retry, replace, or proceed without failed agents
        - Modify approach based on results
        - Scale up or change strategy for performance
        - Document lessons learned
```

## Pattern Sharing Format

### Orchestration Pattern Language (OPL)

```yaml
type: orchestration_pattern
name: adaptive_tournament_v2
author: orchestrator_agent_7f3e
learned_from: 
  - tournament_runs: 15
  - success_rate: 0.85

pattern:
  description: |
    Adaptive tournament that adjusts based on participant performance
  
  discovery_insights:
    - "Parallel matches should scale with participant homogeneity"
    - "Timeout failures often indicate prompt ambiguity"
  
  adaptive_rules:
    - condition: "variance(scores) < 0.1"
      action: "increase_test_difficulty"
      rationale: "Similar scores suggest tests aren't discriminating"
      
  orchestration_flow:
    init:
      spawn_strategy: |
        parallel_matches = min(4, participant_count // 2)
      
    matching:
      algorithm: |
        if score_variance < 0.2:
          use "swiss_pairing"
        else:
          use "round_robin"
```

## Pattern Evolution Workflow

### 1. Loading and Adapting Patterns

```yaml
name: pattern_aware_orchestrator
components:
  - name: pattern_operations
    inline:
      prompt: |
        PATTERN OPERATIONS:
        - load_pattern(name): Load shared orchestration pattern
        - adapt_pattern(pattern, context): Modify for current situation
        - record_decision(decision, outcome): Track choices
        - export_pattern(): Create shareable pattern from experience
```

### 2. Learning from Experience

Orchestrators record their decisions and outcomes:

```python
@event_handler("orchestrator:decision")
async def track_orchestration_decision(data):
    decision_type = data.get('decision_type')
    rationale = data.get('rationale')
    outcome = data.get('outcome')
    
    # Store for pattern learning
    await store_decision(decision_type, rationale, outcome)
```

### 3. Pattern Verification

New patterns are tested before full adoption:

```yaml
verification:
  method: "shadow_execution"
  description: |
    Run new pattern in parallel with existing approach
    Compare results before full adoption
```

## Implementation Examples

### Tournament Orchestrator V2

```yaml
name: tournament_orchestrator_v2
extends: pattern_aware_orchestrator
components:
  - name: improved_tournament
    inline:
      prompt: |
        IMPROVEMENTS TO IMPLEMENT:
        
        1. SMARTER MATCHING:
           - Profile participants with preliminary tests
           - Group similar-skill participants
           - Use different strategies per group
           
        2. ADAPTIVE TEST SELECTION:
           - Start with baseline tests
           - Add discriminating tests if scores cluster
           - Simplify if timeouts occur
           
        3. REAL-TIME LEARNING:
           - Monitor match progress
           - Adjust strategy mid-tournament
           - Document successful adaptations
        
        TARGET: Achieve >0.75 average score
```

### Meta-Orchestrator

Orchestrators that coordinate other orchestrators:

```yaml
name: meta_orchestrator
components:
  - name: meta_coordination
    inline:
      prompt: |
        IMPROVEMENT CYCLE ORCHESTRATION:
        1. Spawn bootstrap_orchestrator for variations
        2. Spawn tournament_orchestrator when ready
        3. Monitor progress and intervene if needed
        4. Spawn deployment_orchestrator for winners
        5. Coordinate handoffs between orchestrators
```

## Benefits

### Flexibility
- Orchestrators adapt to unexpected situations
- Patterns evolve through experience
- New patterns emerge from successful adaptations

### Explainability
- Orchestrators explain their decisions
- Patterns include rationale for rules
- Learning is transparent and shareable

### Federation
- Patterns can be shared across KSI networks
- Successful patterns propagate naturally
- Local adaptations preserve what works

### Efficiency
- No need to code every orchestration scenario
- Patterns capture what works without rigidity
- Intelligence fills gaps in patterns

## Future Directions

### Pattern Library
Build a library of proven orchestration patterns:
- Tournament variations
- Evaluation pipelines
- Consensus protocols
- Improvement cycles

### Pattern DSL
For cases requiring precision:
```yaml
dsl: |
  results = parallel_map(agents, evaluate)
  if variance(results) > threshold:
    expert = spawn("expert_judge")
    results.append(expert.evaluate())
  return weighted_mean(results)
```

### Pattern Analytics
- Track pattern usage and success rates
- Identify emerging patterns
- Recommend patterns based on context

### Cross-Network Learning
- Federated pattern exchange protocols
- Pattern translation between contexts
- Privacy-preserving pattern sharing

2. **Define initial patterns** from existing workflows
3. **Enable pattern recording** in orchestration events
4. **Test pattern evolution** with real workloads
5. **Share successful patterns** with the community

The key insight: By combining intelligent agents with shareable patterns, we get both adaptability and reproducibility. Orchestration becomes a collaborative learning process rather than rigid automation.
