# Phase 4: Attractor Engineering and Phase Boundary Mapping

## Overview

Building on our discovery that multi-agent systems exhibit phase transitions between exploitation and cooperation attractors, Phase 4 focuses on precisely mapping these phase boundaries and engineering desired attractor states. Using only Claude-Sonnet model, we'll identify critical thresholds and develop methods to control phase transitions.

## Core Research Questions

1. **Where exactly are the phase boundaries?** (quantitative thresholds)
2. **Is there hysteresis in the phase transitions?** (different up/down thresholds)
3. **How can we engineer deeper cooperation basins?** (stability enhancement)
4. **What are the vulnerability boundaries?** (system collapse conditions)

## Experimental Framework

### 1. Phase Boundary Mapping

Precise identification of critical thresholds:

```yaml
experiment_1:
  name: "Communication Threshold Identification"
  description: "Find exact point where cooperation emerges"
  
  method:
    - test_points: [0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%]
    - measure: cooperation_rate at each level
    - identify: inflection point where rate > 50%
    - validate: repeat with finer granularity near threshold
  
  expected_findings:
    - critical_threshold: ~15% communication capability
    - transition_sharpness: change over 5% range
    - scale_dependence: threshold vs population size
```

### 2. Hysteresis Testing

Determine if phase transitions show different thresholds going up vs down:

```yaml
experiment_2:
  name: "Phase Transition Asymmetry"
  description: "Test for hysteresis in cooperation-exploitation transitions"
  
  ascending_test:
    - start: 0% communication (exploitation state)
    - increment: add 2% communication per round
    - measure: cooperation rate at each step
    - record: threshold where cooperation > 50%
  
  descending_test:
    - start: 100% communication (cooperation state)
    - decrement: remove 2% communication per round
    - measure: cooperation rate at each step
    - record: threshold where cooperation < 50%
  
  expected_findings:
    - ascending_threshold: ~15% communication
    - descending_threshold: ~10% communication (lower due to established trust)
    - hysteresis_gap: 5% (cooperation is "sticky")
```

### 3. Vulnerability Boundary Mapping

Identify conditions that cause phase collapse:

```yaml
experiment_3:
  name: "System Collapse Conditions"
  description: "Find critical minorities and failure modes"
  
  tests:
    exploiter_invasion:
      - baseline: 100% cooperators
      - inject: [1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%] exploiters
      - measure: system cooperation after 100 rounds
      - identify: critical minority for collapse
    
    cartel_formation:
      - allow: subgroups to coordinate privately
      - vary: coordination group size [2, 3, 5, 10]
      - measure: wealth concentration (Gini)
      - identify: cartel threshold
    
    information_warfare:
      - corrupt: [10%, 25%, 50%] of reputation data
      - measure: trust network stability
      - identify: information integrity threshold
```

### 4. Attractor Engineering

Design interventions to control phase state:

```yaml
experiment_4:
  name: "Basin Depth Modification"
  description: "Engineer deeper cooperation attractors"
  
  interventions:
    redundant_trust:
      - implement: multiple reputation systems
      - measure: resistance to reputation attacks
      
    meta_communication:
      - enable: agents discuss cooperation itself
      - measure: cooperation stability improvement
      
    transition_barriers:
      - add: switching costs between strategies
      - measure: phase transition resistance
  
  success_metrics:
    - time_to_recovery: after perturbation
    - invasion_resistance: % exploiters tolerated
    - stability_duration: rounds without collapse
```
