# Phase 4: Meta-Coordination and Self-Optimization Research Plan

## Overview

Building on the foundation of Phases 1-3, Phase 4 explores meta-coordination where agents optimize their own coordination patterns and cooperation strategies. Using only Claude-Sonnet model, we'll investigate how agents can improve their collective behavior through self-reflection and adaptation.

## Research Questions

1. **Can agents optimize their own coordination patterns?**
2. **How do agents discover better cooperation strategies through experimentation?**
3. **Can agent populations evolve more efficient communication protocols?**
4. **What emerges when agents can modify their own cognitive components?**

## Experimental Framework

### 1. Self-Optimizing Coordination

Agents that analyze and improve their coordination patterns:

```yaml
experiment_1:
  name: "Meta-Coordination Discovery"
  description: "Agents analyze their coordination efficiency and propose improvements"
  
  phases:
    - baseline: "Measure current coordination efficiency"
    - analysis: "Agents identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies"
    - proposal: "Agents suggest coordination improvements"
    - implementation: "Test proposed improvements"
    - evaluation: "Measure improvement delta"
  
  metrics:
    - coordination_efficiency
    - decision_speed
    - consensus_quality
    - adaptation_rate
```

### 2. Strategy Evolution Through Self-Play

Agents develop better strategies through iterative self-play:

```yaml
experiment_2:
  name: "Strategy Self-Improvement"
  description: "Agents play against themselves to discover better strategies"
  
  method:
    - Create agent with base strategy
    - Agent plays against past versions
    - Agent analyzes wins/losses
    - Agent modifies strategy based on analysis
    - Repeat until convergence
  
  expected_outcome:
    - Convergence to Nash equilibrium strategies
    - Discovery of novel cooperation mechanisms
    - Emergence of meta-strategies
```

### 3. Communication Protocol Evolution

Agents develop their own communication languages:

```yaml
experiment_3:
  name: "Emergent Communication Protocols"
  description: "Agents evolve efficient communication protocols"
  
  starting_point:
    - Random signals with no meaning
    - Agents must establish common ground
    
  evolution_process:
    - Agents propose signal-meaning mappings
    - Test communication effectiveness
    - Refine based on success/failure
    - Converge on shared protocol
  
  measurements:
    - Protocol efficiency (bits per decision)
    - Ambiguity reduction over time
    - Speed of convergence
```

### 4. Component Self-Modification

Agents that can add/remove their own cognitive components:

```yaml
experiment_4:
  name: "Adaptive Cognitive Architecture"
  description: "Agents modify their own cognitive components based on task demands"
  
  capabilities:
    - Agents can enable/disable components
    - Agents can adjust component parameters
    - Agents can request new capabilities
  
  scenarios:
    - Simple task → Minimal components
    - Complex coordination → Add components as needed
    - Resource constraints → Optimize component usage
```
