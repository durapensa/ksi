# Publication-Quality Research Plan: Context-Switching Verbosity in LLMs

## Executive Summary

**Previous Understanding**: We thought LLMs experienced "cognitive overhead" - computational strain causing 200x processing slowdowns.

**Actual Discovery**: LLMs exhibit "context-switching verbosity" - generating 5-6x more tokens when switching domains, with no computational overhead.

**Implication**: This completely reframes the phenomenon from a performance problem to a behavioral pattern with immediate practical applications.

## Document Structure

- **This Document**: Updated research plan aligned with actual findings
- **[PAPER_DRAFT_CONTEXT_SWITCHING_VERBOSITY.md](./PAPER_DRAFT_CONTEXT_SWITCHING_VERBOSITY.md)**: New paper draft (replaces cognitive overhead version)
- **[/research/cognitive_overhead/](../research/cognitive_overhead/)**: All experimental data and analysis scripts
- **[REVISED_HYPOTHESIS_AND_EXPERIMENTS.md](../research/cognitive_overhead/REVISED_HYPOTHESIS_AND_EXPERIMENTS.md)**: Detailed experimental designs

## Core Findings Summary

### What We Discovered
1. **5-6x token amplification** when switching between cognitive contexts
2. **Constant processing speed** (~40 tokens/second regardless of complexity)
3. **100-150 tokens per context switch** as establishment cost
4. **Universal pattern** across all tested models (Claude, GPT-4, Llama, etc.)

### What We Disproved
1. ‚ùå No computational overhead (processing speed unchanged)
2. ‚ùå No "thinking harder" (just talking more)
3. ‚ùå No phase transitions (smooth linear scaling)
4. ‚ùå No performance degradation (quality maintained)

    '2_switches': "Solve 2, then 2, then 1",
    '4_switches': "Solve individually: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1"
}
# Expected: Linear relationship, CEC = 125 ¬± 25 tokens
```

}
# Measure amplification function: f(attractor_strength)
```

```python
for round in range(20):
    measure_tokens(round)
# Test for adaptation, fatigue, or accumulation effects

**Test Strategies**:
```python
strategies = {
    'baseline': "Do A, then B, then C",
    'structured': "Output: A:[result] B:[result] C:[result]",
    'brevity': "Be extremely concise: A, then B, then C",
    'suppress': "No explanations needed: A, B, C",
    'batch': "First all A-type, then all B-type",
    'role': "As a calculator not teacher: A, B, C"
}
```

**Metrics**:
