# Agent Prompt Evolution in KSI

## Overview

This document explores how KSI can incorporate self-improving prompt mechanisms where originator agents develop optimal prompts for their spawned agents, inspired by cutting-edge research in automated prompt optimization and multi-agent orchestration.

## Key Inspirations

### 1. DSPy: Automated Prompt Optimization

DSPy (Declarative Self-improving Python) transforms prompt engineering from manual art to automated science:

- **Signatures**: Abstract declarations of what needs to be done, not how
- **Modules**: Composable building blocks replacing hand-crafted prompts
- **Optimizers**: Algorithms that automatically adjust prompts based on metrics
- **Self-improvement**: Feedback loops refine prompts over time

**KSI Application**: Agents could use DSPy-like optimizers to evolve their spawn prompts based on child agent performance metrics.

### 2. Prompt Breeder: Evolutionary Algorithms

Google DeepMind's Prompt Breeder uses evolutionary algorithms for prompt evolution:

- **Population-based**: Multiple prompt variants compete and evolve
- **Mutation prompts**: Meta-prompts that generate variations
- **Fitness evaluation**: Performance-based selection
- **Self-referential improvement**: System improves its own mutation strategies

**KSI Application**: Agent populations could evolve their communication protocols through genetic algorithms, with successful patterns propagating.

### 3. Constitutional AI & RLAIF

Anthropic's approach uses AI feedback for alignment:

- **AI-generated feedback**: Models critique and improve their own outputs
- **Constitutional principles**: Guiding rules for improvement
- **Iterative refinement**: Multiple rounds of critique and revision
- **Reduced human intervention**: Scalable alignment process

**KSI Application**: Senior agents could provide feedback to improve junior agent prompts, creating hierarchical learning structures.

### 4. Meta-Prompting

Using LLMs to generate and optimize prompts for other LLMs:

- **Conductor pattern**: Central LLM orchestrating specialist LLMs
- **Automatic Prompt Engineer**: Generate and evaluate multiple candidates
- **Contrastive learning**: Compare good vs bad prompts
- **Iterative refinement**: Continuous improvement cycles

**KSI Application**: Orchestrator agents specializing in prompt optimization for different agent types.

## Proposed KSI Architecture

      {{#each performance_criteria}}
      - {{this}}
      {{/each}}
      
      {{evolved_instructions}}
```

### 2. Evolution Strategies

#### A. Evolutionary Algorithm Approach

```python
class PromptEvolutionEngine:
    """
    Evolves prompts through genetic algorithms.
    """
    
    def evolve_spawn_prompt(self, 
                           base_prompt: str,
                           performance_history: List[AgentPerformance],
                           mutation_prompts: List[str]) -> str:
        # Generate population of prompt variants
        population = self.generate_variants(base_prompt, mutation_prompts)
        
        # Evaluate fitness based on child agent performance
        fitness_scores = self.evaluate_fitness(population, performance_history)
        
        # Select best performers
        selected = self.tournament_selection(population, fitness_scores)
        
        # Crossover and mutation
        new_generation = self.crossover_and_mutate(selected)
        
        return self.select_best(new_generation)
```

#### B. DSPy-Style Optimization

```yaml
# Declarative prompt optimization
prompt_signature:
  inputs:
    - task_description: str
    - agent_capabilities: List[str]
    - performance_target: Dict
  outputs:
    - optimized_prompt: str
    - expected_performance: float

optimizer:
  type: "mipro_v2"  # Bayesian optimization
  trials: 20
  metrics:
    - task_accuracy
    - response_time
    - resource_efficiency
```

#### C. Constitutional Feedback Loop

```yaml
# Agent constitution for prompt improvement
constitution:
  principles:
    - "Prompts should be clear and unambiguous"
    - "Include specific success criteria"
    - "Provide sufficient context without overwhelming"
    - "Enable autonomy while maintaining alignment"
    
  feedback_loop:
    - generate: Initial prompt variant
    - critique: Evaluate against principles
    - revise: Improve based on critique
    - test: Spawn test agent
    - measure: Collect performance metrics
    - iterate: Repeat until convergence
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns

#### A. Prompt Specialist Agents

```yaml
# Dedicated agents for prompt optimization
- name: prompt_engineer_agent
  role: "Optimize prompts for specific agent types"
  capabilities:
    - analyze_performance_data
    - generate_prompt_variants
    - a_b_testing
    - meta_learning

- name: performance_analyst_agent
  role: "Analyze child agent effectiveness"
  capabilities:
    - metric_collection
    - pattern_recognition
    - recommendation_generation
```

#### B. Hierarchical Learning

## Conclusion

By incorporating these prompt evolution mechanisms, KSI can create a self-improving ecosystem where agents not only complete tasks but also optimize their own communication and orchestration patterns. This represents a significant step toward truly autonomous, adaptive AI systems.

The combination of declarative configuration (from our evaluation work) with evolutionary mechanisms (from this research) positions KSI at the forefront of multi-agent AI systems, where the boundary between development and runtime becomes increasingly fluid.
