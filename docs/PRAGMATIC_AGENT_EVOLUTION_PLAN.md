# Pragmatic Agent System Evolution Plan

## Start Where We Are: Building From Our Foundation

### üéØ Current Assets
1. **Working Game Theoretic Orchestrations** - Tournament systems, strategy discovery, prisoner's dilemma
2. **Optimization Infrastructure** - DSPy/MIPROv2 successfully improving components  
3. **Communication Primitives** - completion:async, state system, event routing
4. **Proven Patterns** - JSON emission, agent spawning, orchestration coordination

## üìà Ground-Up Evolution Strategy

### Step 1: Make Game Theoretic Orchestrations Self-Improving (Week 1)

Start with what works - enhance ONE orchestration at a time:

#### A. **Prisoner's Dilemma + Optimization** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
See: `orchestrations/prisoners_dilemma_self_improving.yaml`

This enhanced version:
- Monitors cooperation rates
- Triggers optimization when below threshold (default 60%)
- Analyzes which player strategy needs improvement
- Stores results for meta-learning
- Learns from past optimization outcomes

**Why This First**: 
- Minimal change to working code
- Tests optimization on behavioral components
- Clear success metric (cooperation rate)
- Already implemented and ready to test!

#### B. **Tournament System + Learning**
Add simple learning to `adaptive_tournament_v2.yaml`:
```yaml
# After tournament completion
EVENT state:entity:create {
  type: "tournament_insights",
  id: "insights_{{tournament_id}}",
  properties: {
    winning_strategies: [...],
    matchup_patterns: {...},
    use_in_future: true
  }
}

# Next tournament checks past insights
EVENT state:entity:query {
  type: "tournament_insights",
  filter: {"use_in_future": true}
} AS past_learnings
```

### Step 2: Basic Agent Communication Patterns (Week 1-2)

#### A. **Simple Direct Messaging Test**
Create `simple_message_passing.yaml`:
```yaml
name: simple_message_passing
description: Test basic agent-to-agent communication

agents:
  researcher:
    vars:
      prompt: |
        Research the topic and share findings directly with analyzer.
        
        When you find something:
        {"event": "completion:async", "data": {"agent_id": "analyzer", "prompt": "I found that {{finding}}. What patterns do you see?"}}
  
  analyzer:
    vars:
      prompt: |
        Analyze findings shared by researcher.
        When you identify patterns, share back:
        {"event": "completion:async", "data": {"agent_id": "researcher", "prompt": "The pattern suggests {{pattern}}. Can you verify?"}}
```

**Test Incrementally**:
1. Two agents passing one message
2. Back-and-forth conversation
3. Three agents in a chain
4. Parallel coordination

#### B. **State-Based Coordination Test**
```yaml
name: state_based_research
description: Agents coordinate through shared state

agents:
  data_collector:
    prompt: |
      Collect data and store in state:
      {"event": "state:entity:create", "data": {"type": "research_data", "id": "data_{{timestamp}}", "properties": {"content": "..."}}}
  
  analyzer:
    prompt: |
      Monitor and analyze collected data:
      {"event": "state:entity:query", "data": {"type": "research_data", "limit": 10}}
```

### Step 3: Combine and Optimize Working Patterns (Week 2)

#### A. **Hybrid Game + Communication**
Modify strategy discovery pattern to use direct messaging:
```yaml
# In strategy_discovery_pattern.yaml
hypothesis_generators:
  on_hypothesis:
    SEND direct_message TO strategy_tester:
      "Test this strategy: {{hypothesis}}"
    
    AWAIT response FROM strategy_tester
    
    IF response.viable:
      SEND to evolution_engine
```

#### B. **Optimize What Works**
Run DSPy optimization on patterns showing promise:
1. Optimize the hypothesis generator persona
2. Optimize the strategy tester instructions  
3. Optimize the coordination messages

### Step 4: Build Knowledge Work Primitives (Week 2-3)

#### A. **Simple Research Pattern**
```yaml
name: basic_research_team
description: Minimal viable research orchestration

strategy: |
  # Just 3 agents, simple coordination
  SPAWN literature_reviewer WITH task: "Find prior work"
  SPAWN data_analyst WITH task: "Analyze patterns"  
  SPAWN synthesizer WITH task: "Combine findings"
  
  # Simple sequential coordination
  AWAIT literature_review
  PASS literature_review TO data_analyst
  AWAIT analysis
  PASS analysis TO synthesizer
  AWAIT synthesis
```

#### B. **Test and Iterate**
1. Run on simple topics
2. Measure output quality
3. Optimize components
4. Add complexity gradually

### Step 5: Emergent Patterns from Simple Rules (Week 3)

#### A. **Swarm Research (Simplified)**
```yaml
name: research_swarm_basic
description: Multiple agents, simple rules, emergent behavior

agents:
  explorer_{{n}}:  # Spawn 5
    prompt: |
      1. Pick a random subtopic of {{topic}}
      2. Research for 2 minutes
      3. If you find something interesting:
         {"event": "state:entity:create", "data": {"type": "finding", "properties": {"content": "...", "interest_score": 0-10}}}
      4. Check others' findings:
         {"event": "state:entity:query", "data": {"type": "finding", "filter": {"interest_score": {"$gte": 7}}}}
      5. If another's finding relates to yours, research the connection
```

**Let emerge**:
- Agents naturally cluster around interesting topics
- High-scoring findings attract more research
- Connections form organically

### Step 6: Meta-Learning from Bottom Up (Week 3-4)

#### A. **Pattern Tracker**
Simple orchestration that watches other orchestrations:
```yaml
name: pattern_observer
description: Learns from orchestration outcomes

on_orchestration_complete:
  EVENT state:entity:create {
    type: "orchestration_outcome",
    properties: {
      pattern: event.pattern_name,
      performance: MEASURE_PERFORMANCE(event),
      key_decisions: EXTRACT_DECISIONS(event)
    }
  }

every_10_completions:
  EVENT state:entity:query {
    type: "orchestration_outcome"
  } AS outcomes
  
  IDENTIFY successful_patterns
  SUGGEST improvements
```

#### B. **Gradual Automation**
1. First: Just track and report
2. Then: Suggest optimizations
3. Later: Auto-trigger optimization
4. Finally: Create new patterns

## The Key Insight

**Start with working code. Add one capability. Test. Optimize. Repeat.**

The meta-orchestration factory isn't the starting point - it's the emergent result of many small improvements to working systems. Build from the ground up, but keep the top-down vision as our guide.
