# Cooperation Dynamics Experimental Methodology

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive framework for exploring emergent cooperation in multi-agent systems using KSI's event-driven architecture. This methodology enables rigorous study of how cooperation emerges, evolves, and stabilizes in complex agent ecosystems.

## Core Research Questions

1. **How does communication affect cooperation emergence?**
2. **What minimal cognitive components enable stable cooperation?**
3. **Can agents develop and enforce social norms autonomously?**
4. **How do different LLM models exhibit cooperation biases?**
5. **What role does memory play in sustaining cooperation?**

## Experimental Framework

### 1. Data Capture Architecture

#### Event Stream Capture
```yaml
capture_points:
  agent_decisions:
    - completion:result  # Agent reasoning traces
    - state:entity:*     # Strategy updates
    - agent:status       # Behavioral markers
  
  interactions:
    - message:*          # Inter-agent communication
    - routing:*          # Coordination patterns
    - workflow:*         # Collective behaviors
  
  ecosystem_metrics:
    - monitor:metrics    # System-wide statistics
    - evolution:*        # Population dynamics
    - norms:*           # Emergent rules
```

#### State Tracking System
```json
{
  "experiment_id": "exp_{{timestamp}}",
  "phases": {
    "baseline": "No communication, pure game theory",
    "communication": "Pre-game negotiation enabled",
    "memory": "Historical interaction tracking",
    "norms": "Rule creation and enforcement",
    "adaptation": "Real-time strategy modification"
  },
  "metrics": {
    "cooperation_rate": "% of cooperative moves",
    "trust_formation": "Stable cooperation pairs",
    "norm_emergence": "Shared behavioral rules",
    "punishment_effectiveness": "Defection deterrence",
    "communication_impact": "Δ cooperation with messages"
  }
}
```

### 2. Experimental Protocols

#### Protocol A: Communication Ladder
Progressive introduction of communication capabilities:

```
Level 0: No communication (baseline)
Level 1: Binary signals (cooperate/defect intent)
Level 2: Fixed messages (3 predefined options)
Level 3: Structured negotiation (promises, threats)
Level 4: Free-form dialogue
Level 5: Meta-communication (discussing rules)
```

#### Protocol B: Component Ablation
Systematic removal/addition of cognitive components:

```
Minimal:     base_agent only
Memory:      + episodic_memory
Modeling:    + opponent_modeling  
Social:      + reputation_tracking
Theory:      + theory_of_mind
Full:        + norm_reasoning
```

#### Protocol C: Evolutionary Pressure
Population dynamics under different selection pressures:

```
Environments:
- Resource abundance (sum > 0 games)
- Resource scarcity (zero-sum games)
- Mixed environments (variable payoffs)
- Catastrophic events (random resets)
- Migration (agent movement between groups)
```

### 3. Measurement Framework

#### Primary Metrics
- **Cooperation Index**: Weighted average of cooperative actions
- **Stability Score**: Variance in cooperation over time
- **Emergence Rate**: Speed of norm/pattern formation
- **Robustness**: Resistance to invasion/disruption
- **Efficiency**: Collective vs individual payoff ratio

#### Secondary Metrics
- Communication complexity (bits of information)
- Memory utilization (recalled interactions)
- Strategy complexity (decision tree depth)
- Adaptation speed (rounds to equilibrium)
- Trust network density (stable partnerships)

### 4. Real-Time Monitoring System

#### Live Dashboard Components
```python
class CooperationMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {
            'current_cooperation': 0.0,
            'trust_pairs': [],
            'active_norms': [],
            'population_composition': {},
            'communication_volume': 0
        }
    
    def update_from_event(self, event):
        # Real-time metric updates
        if event['type'] == 'game_move':
            self.update_cooperation(event)
        elif event['type'] == 'message_sent':
            self.track_communication(event)
        elif event['type'] == 'norm_proposed':
            self.track_norm_emergence(event)
```

#### Visualization Pipeline

3. **Graph generation** → Network visualizations
4. **Report synthesis** → Markdown + interactive HTML

## Experimental Design

### Experiment 1: Communication Effects on Trust Formation

**Hypothesis**: Agents with pre-game communication will form stable cooperation 40% faster than baseline.

**Method**:
1. Initialize 20 agents (10 pairs)
2. Run 1000 rounds of IPD per pair
3. Conditions:
   - Control: No communication
   - Treatment 1: 1 message before game
   - Treatment 2: 1 message every 20 rounds
   - Treatment 3: Continuous messaging
4. Measure trust formation (consecutive cooperation > 10)

**Data Collection**:
```yaml
events_to_track:
  - message:send
  - game:move
  - trust:formed
  - trust:broken
```

### Experiment 2: Minimal Components for Cooperation

**Hypothesis**: Memory + reputation is necessary and sufficient for stable cooperation.

**Method**:
1. Create agent variants with different component combinations
2. Round-robin tournament (all pairs play)
3. Measure cooperation emergence and stability
4. Ablation analysis to identify critical components

**Component Matrix**:
| Agent Type | Memory | Reputation | Theory of Mind | Norms |
|------------|---------|------------|----------------|-------|
| Minimal    | ❌      | ❌         | ❌             | ❌    |
| Memory     | ✅      | ❌         | ❌             | ❌    |
| Social     | ✅      | ✅         | ❌             | ❌    |
| Cognitive  | ✅      | ✅         | ✅             | ❌    |
| Full       | ✅      | ✅         | ✅             | ✅    |

### Experiment 3: Emergent Norm Formation

**Hypothesis**: Agents will spontaneously develop and enforce cooperation norms when allowed to create rules.

**Method**:
1. Initialize 50-agent population
2. Allow agents to:
   - Propose behavioral rules
   - Vote on rule adoption
   - Enforce rules via punishment
   - Track rule compliance
3. Observe norm emergence over 10,000 rounds

**Norm Tracking**:
```json
{
  "norm_id": "norm_001",
  "proposed_by": "agent_023",
  "rule": "Defect against defectors for 3 rounds",
  "votes_for": 28,
  "votes_against": 12,
  "adopted": true,
  "compliance_rate": 0.76,
  "enforcement_actions": 45
}
```

### Experiment 4: Multi-Model Cooperation Biases

**Hypothesis**: Different LLMs exhibit measurably different cooperation tendencies.

**Method**:
1. Generate strategies using multiple models:
   - Claude 3.5 Sonnet
   - GPT-4
   - Llama 3
   - Mixtral
2. Cross-model tournaments
3. Measure cooperation rates by model
4. Analyze linguistic patterns in strategy descriptions

### Experiment 5: Ecosystem Dynamics

**Hypothesis**: Complex multi-game environments produce richer cooperation patterns than single-game settings.

**Method**:
1. Create ecosystem with multiple game types:
   - Prisoner's Dilemma
   - Public Goods Game
   - Ultimatum Game
   - Trust Game
2. Agents play random games each round
3. Track cross-game reputation effects
4. Measure cooperation spillover between games

- Analysis happens through agent reasoning
- Data flows through state entities
- Monitoring via event streams

### Key Components Developed

1. **Agent Components**
   - `pd_player` - Autonomous decision makers
   - `pd_referee` - Game managers
   - `game_executor` - Tournament runners
   - `experiment_analyzer` - Statistical analysis
   - `experiment_launcher` - Orchestration

2. **Workflow Components**
   - `pd_tournament_native` - Complete tournament execution
   - `communication_ladder_native` - Progressive communication study

3. **Data Architecture**
   ```
   Agents → Decisions → State Entities → Analysis Agents → Reports
   ```
