   - Test in isolation
   - Test in combination
   - Refine based on results

3. **Validation Framework**

   - Error handling validation
   - Performance benchmarking

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Multi-component workflows
   - Agent spawning tests
   - Communication verification
   - End-to-end scenarios

3. **Performance Testing**

## Next Steps

1. Create `components/base/agent_core.md` with fundamental behaviors
2. Test with simple tasks (arithmetic, text analysis, etc.)
3. Iterate on prompt engineering
4. Create task_executor.md building on agent_core
5. Continue building foundation components

## Long-Term Vision

The ultimate goal is to create a self-improving system where:
- Agents can optimize their own prompts
- Orchestrations can tune themselves based on performance
- New components can be generated automatically
- The system becomes increasingly effective over time

This will enable KSI to tackle increasingly complex tasks while maintaining high performance and reliability.
