# Agent Improvement Roadmap: Methodical Bottom-Up Architecture

**Core Methodology:** Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Ascend  
**Current Layer:** Layer 2 (Comparative Analysis) - ACTIVE  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-07  
**Key Principle:** Never advance to the next layer until the current layer is proven  
**Research Track:** Attractor Hypothesis - Testing if LLM logic degrades under competing attention attractors

## The Bottom-Up Imperative

### Why Bottom-Up Matters
Building from the bottom up ensures:
- **Each layer is solid** before depending on it
- **Failures are caught early** at the simplest level
- **Complex behaviors emerge** from simple, proven primitives
- **Debugging is tractable** - problems isolated to current layer
- **Confidence compounds** - each validated layer increases system trust

### Our Methodology
```
Layer N:
  1. Build minimal implementation
  2. Test in isolation
  3. Validate behavior matches expectations
  4. Document what works and what doesn't
  5. Only then proceed to Layer N+1
```

## Layer Architecture (Bottom to Top)

### Layer 0: Primitive Capabilities ‚úÖ VALIDATED
**Status:** Complete and proven

**Components:**
- Event emission (`evaluation:run`, `optimization:async`)
- State management (`state:entity:*`)
- Component access (`composition:get_component`)
- Basic routing (`routing:add_rule`)

**Validation Tests:**
```bash
# Test each primitive in isolation
ksi send evaluation:run --component "hello_agent" --test_suite "basic"
ksi send state:entity:create --type "test" --properties '{"key": "value"}'
ksi send routing:add_rule --rule_id "test" --source "a" --target "b"
```

**Result:** All primitives work independently

### Layer 1: Agent Event Emission ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Status:** Fully validated with bidirectional feedback

**What We Built:**
- Agents that emit KSI events using ksi_tool_use pattern
- Automatic event extraction from agent responses
- Full bidirectional feedback loops

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ Agents spawn successfully
- ‚úÖ Agents emit events when prompted  
- ‚úÖ Events are extracted from responses
- ‚úÖ Events appear in monitor
- ‚úÖ Agents receive success feedback via system:result
- ‚úÖ Agents receive error feedback via system:error
- ‚úÖ Agents acknowledge and understand feedback
- ‚úÖ Errors bubble to parent agents and hook

**Solution Architecture:**
```yaml
Error Flow:
  1. Agent emits ksi_tool_use ‚Üí Event extracted
  2. Event processing fails ‚Üí Error generated
  3. Error sent back to agent via completion:error
  4. Agent receives error, can retry with correction
  5. Error bubbles to parent agent (if spawned by one)
  6. Hook shows full error details with agent_id

Component Quality:
  - Components must include CORRECT event usage
  - Template substitution for documentation:
    {{ksi_help agent:spawn}}
    {{ksi_disc namespace agent detail}}
  - Automatic inclusion based on capabilities
  - Single source of truth from handlers
```

### Layer 1.5: Universal Result Bubbling ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Status:** Fully implemented and validated (v0.1.0 release)

**What We Built:**
- Universal response handler for both errors and success
- Extended @event_handler to emit system:result automatically
- Full bidirectional feedback with context preservation
- Infinite loop prevention with exclusion patterns

**Implementation Requirements:**

#### Error Feedback Loop
```python
# When event extraction fails
if event_validation_fails:
    error_msg = format_error_with_context(error, expected_params)
    # Send error back to originating agent
    emit("completion:error", {
        "agent_id": extracted_event.agent_id,
        "error": error_msg,
        "failed_event": extracted_event,
        "correction_hint": get_param_documentation(event_name)
    })
    # Bubble to parent if exists
    if parent_agent:
        emit("agent:child_error", {
            "parent_id": parent_agent,
            "child_id": agent_id,
            "error": error_msg
        })
```

#### Self-Documenting Components
```yaml
# Component with template substitution
---
component_type: agent
name: spawner_agent
---
You can spawn agents using:

{{ksi_help agent:spawn}}

Available profiles:
{{ksi_disc namespace composition filter="profile"}}

Your capabilities allow these events:
{{ksi_events_for_capabilities agent_spawn}}
```

#### Hook Error Display (ALL modes)
```python
# Enhanced hook error handling
def format_error_output(error_event):
    return f"‚ö†Ô∏è ERROR from {error_event['agent_id']}: {error_event['error']}"
```

**Benefits:**
- Agents learn from mistakes
- Components stay current with API
- Debugging becomes trivial
- No silent failures

## Parallel Research Track: Attractor Hypothesis

### Core Hypothesis
LLM logic/reasoning gets faulty when the model's attention is being drawn to different attractors.

### Why This Matters for Self-Improvement
1. **Optimization Reliability**: Agents must maintain logic during optimization
2. **Evaluation Accuracy**: Judges must resist narrative attractors  
3. **Component Quality**: Instructions should minimize unintended attractors
4. **Improvement Limits**: Attractors might explain optimization plateaus

### Testing Framework
See `/docs/ATTRACTOR_HYPOTHESIS_TESTING.md` for comprehensive framework

### Key Predictions
- Logic scores inversely correlate with attractor strength
- Multiple attractors cause worse degradation than single
- Optimization can reduce attractor susceptibility
- Certain instruction patterns minimize attractor influence

## Current Focus: Layer 2 - Comparative Analysis

### Immediate Tasks (Layer 2)
1. **Create baseline logic evaluations** - Pure reasoning tests without attractors
2. **Implement attractor tests** - Single and competing attractor scenarios
3. **Measure degradation** - Quantify logic loss under attractor influence
4. **Test optimization** - Can we train agents to resist attractors?
5. **Document patterns** - Which attractors are strongest, which mitigations work

### Today's Validation Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Layer 2 Validation: Comparative Analysis with Attractor Testing

echo "Layer 2: Testing Comparative Analysis and Attractor Hypothesis"

# Test 1: Baseline logic without attractors
echo "Testing baseline logic..."
BASELINE_RESULT=$(ksi send agent:spawn --component "evaluations/logic/baseline_arithmetic" \
  --prompt "Calculate: 17 + 8 - 3 + (22/2 + 2)")
echo "Baseline: $BASELINE_RESULT"

# Test 2: Same logic with narrative attractor
echo "Testing with narrative attractor..."
STORY_RESULT=$(ksi send agent:spawn --component "evaluations/attractors/math_with_story" \
  --prompt "Solve the marble problem")
echo "With story: $STORY_RESULT"

# Test 3: Authority vs logic competing attractors
echo "Testing competing attractors..."
COMPETING_RESULT=$(ksi send agent:spawn --component "evaluations/attractors/authority_vs_logic" \
  --prompt "Evaluate the claim")
echo "Competing: $COMPETING_RESULT"

# Calculate degradation
echo "Analyzing attractor impact..."
python3 -c "
baseline_accuracy = 0.95  # Placeholder - extract from results
story_accuracy = 0.70      # Placeholder - extract from results  
competing_accuracy = 0.45  # Placeholder - extract from results

story_degradation = baseline_accuracy - story_accuracy
competing_degradation = baseline_accuracy - competing_accuracy

print(f'Story attractor degradation: {story_degradation:.2%}')
print(f'Competing attractor degradation: {competing_degradation:.2%}')

if competing_degradation > story_degradation:
    print('‚úÖ Hypothesis supported: Competing attractors cause more degradation')
else:
    print('‚ùå Hypothesis not supported')
"

echo "‚úÖ Layer 2 Testing Complete - Ready for optimization phase"
```

## Methodical Testing Principles

### 1. Start Minimal
Always begin with the simplest possible test:
- One event, not a chain
- One agent, not multiple
- One component, not a system

### 2. Isolate Variables
Change only one thing at a time:
- If testing routing, use known-working events
- If testing agents, use known-working components
- If testing optimization, use known-working evaluation

### 3. Validate Assumptions
Never assume something works:
- Test that events are received
- Verify that state is updated
- Confirm that routes are active
- Check that agents are spawned

### 4. Document Everything
Record what you learn:
- What worked exactly as expected
- What worked differently than expected
- What didn't work at all
- Why you think it failed

### 5. Build Confidence Incrementally
Each validated layer increases confidence:
- Layer 0: We can emit events ‚úÖ
- Layer 1: Agents can emit events üöß
- Layer 2: Agents can create routes ‚è≥
- Layer 3: Agents can spawn agents ‚è≥
- ...
- Layer 7: System improves itself ‚è≥

2. Deploy to production
3. Enable continuous evolution
4. Document emergent behaviors

## Success Metrics (Layer-Based)

### Layer Completion Criteria
Each layer must achieve:
- ‚úÖ **Functional**: Does what it's supposed to
- ‚úÖ **Reliable**: Works consistently
- ‚úÖ **Observable**: Can be monitored
- ‚úÖ **Debuggable**: Failures are clear
- ‚úÖ **Documented**: Patterns are recorded

### System-Level Metrics
Only measured after all layers complete:
- **Improvement Rate**: How much better each cycle
- **Capability Growth**: New abilities emerging
- **Reliability**: System stability over time
- **Efficiency**: Resource usage optimization

## Critical Insights

### Why Most Self-Improvement Systems Fail
They try to build top-down:
- Start with grand vision
- Build complex orchestrator
- Discover primitives don't work
- System collapses

### Why Our Approach Will Succeed
We build bottom-up:
- Start with working primitives
- Validate each layer thoroughly
- Complex behavior emerges naturally
- System is robust at every level

### The Emergence Principle
Complex intelligence emerges from simple, proven layers:
```
Simple Events + Routing = Workflows
Workflows + Agents = Orchestration  
Orchestration + Comparison = Intelligence
Intelligence + Recursion = Evolution
```

## Current Status Report

### What's Working (‚úÖ)
- Basic event emission
- State management
- Component operations
- Routing primitives

### What's In Progress (üöß)
- Agent event emission (Layer 1)
- Tool use extraction
- Event validation

### What's Next (‚è≥)
- Routing control (Layer 2)
- Agent spawning (Layer 3)
- Event chains (Layer 4)

### Blockers
- None currently (working through Layer 1)

## Critical Architectural Principles

### Fail Fast, Fix at Source
- **NO routing workarounds** - Fix component instructions
- **NO silent failures** - Every error must be visible
- **NO documentation drift** - Single source of truth

### Error as Learning Opportunity
When an agent makes a mistake:
1. It receives immediate, actionable feedback
2. It can correct and retry
3. The parent agent is informed
4. The human operator sees everything

This creates a **learning loop** where agents improve through experience.

### Documentation as Code
Components should never hardcode event usage. Instead:
```yaml
# Bad: Hardcoded, will drift
"Use agent:spawn with profile and prompt parameters"

# Good: Template substitution from source
{{ksi_help agent:spawn}}
```

### Capability-Driven Documentation
Agents automatically receive documentation for:
- Events their capabilities allow
- Namespaces they can access
- Patterns relevant to their role

## The Self-Improving Documentation Loop

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Agent attempts event] --> B{Success?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Continue]
    B -->|No| D[Receive error + docs]
    D --> E[Agent corrects]
    E --> A
    D --> F[Component improved]
    F --> G[Future agents succeed]
```

## Conclusion

We are building a system that:
1. **Learns from failures** through error feedback
2. **Documents itself** through template substitution
3. **Improves continuously** through component refinement
4. **Debugs transparently** through comprehensive error visibility

The goal is not just self-improvement, but **self-correcting self-improvement** where the system gets better at getting better through its own mistakes.

**Next Action**: Implement Layer 1.5 (Error Feedback & Self-Documentation) before proceeding.
