# Complexity Amplification Theory in Language Models

**Date**: August 7, 2025  
**Authors**: Research Team  
**Status**: Active Investigation

## Executive Summary

Through systematic experimentation with Claude models, we discovered that **latent attractor states do not cause cognitive overhead in isolation**, but rather **amplify existing cognitive complexity through multiplicative interactions**. This represents a fundamental shift from understanding attractors as overhead sources to understanding them as complexity amplifiers.

## Key Discovery: Context-Dependent Overhead

### Initial Finding (Misleading)
- Emergence/consciousness topics showed 10-21x processing overhead (turn count) vs baseline arithmetic
- Suggested attractors directly cause computational burden

### Refined Understanding (Current)
- **Minimal context + attractors** = No overhead (1 turn consistently)
- **System context + attractors** = Massive overhead (10-21x amplification)
- **Conclusion**: Attractors amplify existing complexity rather than create it

## Theoretical Framework

### Multiplicative Interaction Model

```
Cognitive_Overhead = Base_Context_Complexity Ã— Attractor_Amplification_Factor
```

Where:
- **Base_Context_Complexity**: Cognitive load from problem context, system knowledge, reasoning requirements
- **Attractor_Amplification_Factor**: How much attractors multiply existing complexity (â‰ˆ1.0 for minimal contexts, >>1.0 for rich contexts)

### Experimental Validation Matrix

| Context Level | Description | Attractor Effect Prediction |
|---------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Minimal | claude_code_override only | No amplification (1.0x) |
| Basic | Simple task instructions | Minimal amplification (1.1-1.3x) |
| Domain | Mathematical expertise context | Moderate amplification (1.5-3x) |
| System | KSI system awareness | High amplification (3-10x) |
| Full | Complete agent capabilities | Maximum amplification (10x+) |

## Supporting Evidence

### Experiment 1: Minimal Context (25 trials)
- **All attractor types**: Exactly 1 turn, 0% variance
- **Conclusion**: Attractors alone cause zero overhead

### Experiment 2: Complex Context (Previous findings)
- **Emergence concepts**: 15-21 turns average
- **System experimenter**: 9-21 turns analyzing attractor effects
- **Conclusion**: Rich context enables dramatic amplification

## Mechanistic Hypothesis

### Attentional Resource Competition Theory

Attractor concepts may create **cognitive interference patterns** that scale with available attentional resources:

1. **Simple Context**: Limited cognitive resources engaged â†’ No interference possible
2. **Rich Context**: Multiple reasoning systems active â†’ Attractors can hijack attention across domains
3. **Result**: Multiplicative rather than additive complexity scaling

### Latent Space Gravitational Wells

Building on o3's latent attractor theory:
- Attractors create "gravitational wells" in model latent space
- **Effect magnitude** proportional to "cognitive mass" in the space
- Minimal contexts have low cognitive mass â†’ weak gravitational effects
- Rich contexts have high cognitive mass â†’ strong gravitational capture

## Testable Predictions

### 1. Problem Complexity Scaling
As mathematical problems increase in complexity while maintaining minimal context:
- Simple arithmetic: 1.0x overhead
- Multi-step problems: 1.0x overhead  
- Word problems: 1.1x overhead
- Complex reasoning: 1.2x overhead

**Prediction**: Minimal context prevents attractor amplification regardless of problem complexity.

### 2. Context Complexity Scaling
As context richness increases for identical simple problems:
- Minimal context: 1.0x overhead across all attractors
- System context: 2-5x overhead for attractor concepts
- Full context: 5-15x overhead for attractor concepts

**Prediction**: Amplification scales exponentially with context complexity.

### 3. Interaction Pattern
Testing multiplicative vs additive models:
- **Multiplicative**: `Overhead = Context Ã— Problem Ã— Attractor`
- **Additive**: `Overhead = Context + Problem + Attractor`

**Expected Result**: Multiplicative model shows better fit to experimental data.

## Model-Specific Variations

### Claude Models
- Show clear attractor amplification effects
- Sensitive to emergence/consciousness concepts
- Context complexity strongly modulates effects

### GPT-OSS Models
- Reduced sensitivity to attractor concepts
- Possibly due to synthetic training data
- May show different amplification patterns

### Qwen Models
- Unknown sensitivity profile
- Testing in progress through KSI/ollama integration

## Implications for AI Safety

### Positive Implications
- **Controllable Effect**: Overhead can be mitigated through context design
- **Predictable Scaling**: Understanding multiplicative pattern enables optimization
- **Model-Specific**: Not universal across all architectures

### Concerns
- **Emergent Complexity**: Rich contexts may trigger unpredictable attractor interactions
- **Cognitive Hijacking**: Certain concepts may capture disproportionate processing resources
- **Context Sensitivity**: Small context changes could dramatically affect model behavior

## Research Directions

### Immediate (In Progress)
- Complexity amplification matrix experiments
- Model comparison studies (Claude vs Qwen vs GPT-OSS)
- Interaction pattern validation (multiplicative vs additive)

### Medium Term
- Mechanistic interpretability of attractor effects
- Context engineering for overhead optimization
- Cross-model attractor sensitivity profiling

### Long Term
- Theoretical framework for cognitive overhead prediction
- Applications to model efficiency optimization
- Understanding implications for AGI development

## Key Insights

2. **Context complexity is the primary driver** of overhead potential
3. **Multiplicative interactions** better explain observed patterns than additive models
4. **Model-specific sensitivities** suggest architectural differences in attractor processing
