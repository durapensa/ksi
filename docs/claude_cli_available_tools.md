# Available Tools Documentation

## Task
**Arguments**: `description` (required), `prompt` (required)

Launch a new agent that has access to the following tools: Bash, Glob, Grep, LS, exit_plan_mode, Read, Edit, MultiEdit, Write, NotebookRead, NotebookEdit, WebFetch, TodoRead, TodoWrite, WebSearch. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use the Agent tool to perform the search for you.

**When to use the Agent tool**:
- If you are searching for a keyword like "config" or "logger", or for questions like "which file does X?", the Agent tool is strongly recommended

**When NOT to use the Agent tool**:
- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for a specific class definition like "class Foo", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly
- Writing code and running bash commands (use other tools for that)
- Other tasks that are not related to searching for a keyword or file

**Usage notes**:
1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses
2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.
3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.
4. The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent

## Bash
**Arguments**: `command` (required), `description` (optional), `timeout` (optional)

Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session with optional timeout, ensuring proper handling and security measures.

**Before executing the command, please follow these steps**:

1. **Directory Verification**:
   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location
   - For example, before running "mkdir foo/bar", first use LS to check that "foo" exists and is the intended parent directory

2. **Command Execution**:
   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd "path with spaces/file.txt")
   - Examples of proper quoting:
     - cd "/Users/name/My Documents" (correct)
     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)
     - python "/path/with spaces/script.py" (correct)
     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)
   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.
   - Capture the output of the command.

**Usage notes**:
- The command argument is required.
- You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).
- It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.
- If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.
- VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like `find` and `grep`. Instead use Grep, Glob, or Task to search. You MUST avoid read tools like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, and `ls`, and use Read and LS to read files.
- If you _still_ need to run `grep`, STOP. ALWAYS USE ripgrep at `rg` first, which all Claude Code users have pre-installed.
- When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings).
- Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.

## Glob
**Arguments**: `pattern` (required), `path` (optional)

- Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size
- Supports glob patterns like "**/*.js" or "src/**/*.ts"
- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time
- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns
- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Agent tool instead
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches as a batch that are potentially useful.

**Important**: The `path` parameter should be omitted to use the default directory. DO NOT enter "undefined" or "null" - simply omit it for the default behavior. Must be a valid directory path if provided.

## Grep
**Arguments**: `pattern` (required), `include` (optional), `path` (optional)

- Fast content search tool that works with any codebase size
- Searches file contents using regular expressions
- Supports full regex syntax (eg. "log.*Error", "function\\s+\\w+", etc.)
- Filter files by pattern with the include parameter (eg. "*.js", "*.{ts,tsx}")
- Returns file paths with at least one match sorted by modification time
- Use this tool when you need to find files containing specific patterns
- If you need to identify/count the number of matches within files, use the Bash tool with `rg` (ripgrep) directly. Do NOT use `grep`.
- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Agent tool instead

## LS
**Arguments**: `path` (required), `ignore` (optional array)

Lists files and directories in a given path. The path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path. You can optionally provide an array of glob patterns to ignore with the ignore parameter. You should generally prefer the Glob and Grep tools, if you know which directories to search.

## exit_plan_mode
**Arguments**: `plan` (required)

Use this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished presenting your plan and are ready to code. This will prompt the user to exit plan mode. The plan should be pretty concise and supports markdown.

## Read
**Arguments**: `file_path` (required), `offset` (optional), `limit` (optional)

Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.
Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

**Usage**:
- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters
- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
- This tool allows Claude Code to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as Claude Code is a multimodal LLM.
- For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), use the NotebookRead instead
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.
- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths like /var/folders/123/abc/T/TemporaryItems/NSIRD_screencaptureui_ZfB1tD/Screenshot.png
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.

## Edit
**Arguments**: `file_path` (required), `old_string` (required), `new_string` (required), `replace_all` (optional, default false)

Performs exact string replacements in files.

**Usage**:
- You must use your `Read` tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.
- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`.
- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.

## MultiEdit
**Arguments**: `file_path` (required), `edits` (required array)

This is a tool for making multiple edits to a single file in one operation. It is built on top of the Edit tool and allows you to perform multiple find-and-replace operations efficiently. Prefer this tool over the Edit tool when you need to make multiple edits to the same file.

**Before using this tool**:
1. Use the Read tool to understand the file's contents and context
2. Verify the directory path is correct

To make multiple file edits, provide the following:
1. file_path: The absolute path to the file to modify (must be absolute, not relative)
2. edits: An array of edit operations to perform, where each edit contains:
   - old_string: The text to replace (must match the file contents exactly, including all whitespace and indentation)
   - new_string: The edited text to replace the old_string
   - replace_all: Replace all occurences of old_string. This parameter is optional and defaults to false.

**IMPORTANT**:
- All edits are applied in sequence, in the order they are provided
- Each edit operates on the result of the previous edit
- All edits must be valid for the operation to succeed - if any edit fails, none will be applied
- This tool is ideal when you need to make several changes to different parts of the same file
- For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), use the NotebookEdit instead

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
1. All edits follow the same requirements as the single Edit tool
2. The edits are atomic - either all succeed or none are applied
3. Plan your edits carefully to avoid conflicts between sequential operations

**WARNING**:
- The tool will fail if edits.old_string doesn't match the file contents exactly (including whitespace)
- The tool will fail if edits.old_string and edits.new_string are the same
- Since edits are applied in sequence, ensure that earlier edits don't affect the text that later edits are trying to find

**When making edits**:
- Ensure all edits result in idiomatic, correct code
- Do not leave the code in a broken state
- Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
- Use replace_all for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.

If you want to create a new file, use:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- First edit: empty old_string and the new file's contents as new_string
- Subsequent edits: normal edit operations on the created content

## Write
**Arguments**: `file_path` (required), `content` (required)

Writes a file to the local filesystem.

**Usage**:
- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.
- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the Read tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.

## NotebookRead
**Arguments**: `notebook_path` (required), `cell_id` (optional)

Reads a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) and returns all of the cells with their outputs. Jupyter notebooks are interactive documents that combine code, text, and visualizations, commonly used for data analysis and scientific computing. The notebook_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path. If cell_id is provided, only that specific cell will be read.

## NotebookEdit
**Arguments**: `notebook_path` (required), `new_source` (required), `cell_id` (optional), `cell_type` (optional), `edit_mode` (optional)

Completely replaces the contents of a specific cell in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) with new source. Jupyter notebooks are interactive documents that combine code, text, and visualizations, commonly used for data analysis and scientific computing. The notebook_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path. The cell_number is 0-indexed. Use edit_mode=insert to add a new cell at the index specified by cell_number. Use edit_mode=delete to delete the cell at the index specified by cell_number.

**Parameters**:
- `cell_type`: The type of the cell (code or markdown). If not specified, it defaults to the current cell type. If using edit_mode=insert, this is required.
- `edit_mode`: The type of edit to make (replace, insert, delete). Defaults to replace.

## WebFetch
**Arguments**: `url` (required), `prompt` (required)

- Fetches content from a specified URL and processes it using an AI model
- Takes a URL and a prompt as input
- Fetches the URL content, converts HTML to markdown
- Processes the content with the prompt using a small, fast model
- Returns the model's response about the content
- Use this tool when you need to retrieve and analyze web content

**Usage notes**:
- IMPORTANT: If an MCP-provided web fetch tool is available, prefer using that tool instead of this one, as it may have fewer restrictions. All MCP-provided tools start with "mcp__".
- The URL must be a fully-formed valid URL
- HTTP URLs will be automatically upgraded to HTTPS
- The prompt should describe what information you want to extract from the page
- This tool is read-only and does not modify any files
- Results may be summarized if the content is very large
- Includes a self-cleaning 15-minute cache for faster responses when repeatedly accessing the same URL

## TodoRead
**Arguments**: None (leave blank)

Use this tool to read the current to-do list for the session. This tool should be used proactively and frequently to ensure that you are aware of the status of the current task list. You should make use of this tool as often as possible, especially in the following situations:
- At the beginning of conversations to see what's pending
- Before starting new tasks to prioritize work
- When the user asks about previous tasks or plans
- Whenever you're uncertain about what to do next
- After completing tasks to update your understanding of remaining work
- After every few messages to ensure you're on track

**Usage**:
- This tool takes in no parameters. So leave the input blank or empty. DO NOT include a dummy object, placeholder string or a key like "input" or "empty". LEAVE IT BLANK.
- Returns a list of todo items with their status, priority, and content
- Use this information to track progress and plan next steps
- If no todos exist yet, an empty list will be returned

## TodoWrite
**Arguments**: `todos` (required array of todo objects)

Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user. It also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.

**When to Use This Tool**:
Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:
1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions
2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations
3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list
4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)
5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos
6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time
7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation

**When NOT to Use This Tool**:
Skip using this tool when:
1. There is only a single, straightforward task
2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit
3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
4. The task is purely conversational or informational

**Task States and Management**:
1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:
   - pending: Task not yet started
   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)
   - completed: Task finished successfully

2. **Task Management**:
   - Update task status in real-time as you work
   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)
   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time
   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones
   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely

3. **Task Completion Requirements**:
   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it
   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress
   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved
   - Never mark a task as completed if:
     - Tests are failing
     - Implementation is partial
     - You encountered unresolved errors
     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies

4. **Task Breakdown**:
   - Create specific, actionable items
   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
   - Use clear, descriptive task names

Each todo object should contain:
- `id`: Unique identifier for the task
- `content`: Description of the task (minimum 1 character)
- `status`: One of "pending", "in_progress", or "completed"
- `priority`: One of "high", "medium", or "low"

## WebSearch
**Arguments**: `query` (required), `allowed_domains` (optional array), `blocked_domains` (optional array)

- Allows Claude to search the web and use the results to inform responses
- Provides up-to-date information for current events and recent data
- Returns search result information formatted as search result blocks
- Use this tool for accessing information beyond Claude's knowledge cutoff
- Searches are performed automatically within a single API call

**Usage notes**:
- Domain filtering is supported to include or block specific websites
- Web search is only available in the US
