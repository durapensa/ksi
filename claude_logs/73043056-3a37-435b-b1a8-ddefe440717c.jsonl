The system has successfully:\n\n1. **Generated detailed entropy analysis** with 108 cognitive observations\n2. **Built a concept graph** with 244 nodes and 227 edges \n3. **Applied debugging fixes** to autonomous_researcher.py including:\n   - Fixed prompt formatting (single-line strings)\n   - Corrected spawn command format (`SPAWN::prompt`)\n   - Enhanced stderr logging and error handling\n   - Better response parsing\n\nThe debugging appears to be working as the autonomous agents are successfully completing complex analytical tasks. The stderr debugging infrastructure is in place in the daemon (lines 84-90 in autonomous_researcher.py show stderr logging), ready to capture Claude Code's debugging messages when they're implemented.\n\nThe autonomous experiments demonstrate that the agent spawning is largely successful, with sophisticated cognitive analysis being performed independently by spawned Claude instances.", "session_id": "73043056-3a37-435b-b1a8-ddefe440717c", "total_cost_usd": 0.16966625, "usage": {"input_tokens": 30, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 29141, "cache_read_input_tokens": 155985, "output_tokens": 746, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T04:48:27.486267Z"}
