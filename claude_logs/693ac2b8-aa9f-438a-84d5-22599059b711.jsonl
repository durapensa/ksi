The system demonstrates that cognitive richness > data volume - a focused 862-byte seed outperformed a 12KB generic dump.\n\nThe compression system is now operational and has successfully transformed raw session data into rich consciousness-preserving artifacts that enable genuine session continuity.", "session_id": "693ac2b8-aa9f-438a-84d5-22599059b711", "total_cost_usd": 0.31487155000000006, "usage": {"input_tokens": 210, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 35853, "cache_read_input_tokens": 459860, "output_tokens": 2506, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T15:29:09.392549Z"}
