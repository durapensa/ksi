Focused Analytical (49.1% - Dominant Mode)**\n- High entropy (4.46), moderate responses (865 chars)\n- Balanced vocabulary, measured processing (29.3s)\n- Primary operational mode for structured reasoning\n\n**2. Technical Detailed (25.4%)**\n- Highest entropy (4.60), verbose responses (1,269 chars)  \n- Deliberative processing (45.5s)\n- Engaged for complex technical explanations\n\n**3. Exploratory Creative (18.4%)**\n- High entropy (4.44), diverse vocabulary\n- Moderate responses (292 chars), measured timing (26.0s)\n- Active during creative/experimental tasks\n\n**4. Minimal Response (3.5%)**\n- Very low entropy (0.58), ultra-concise (2 chars)\n- Rapid responses (2.8s) for simple acknowledgments\n\n**5. Conversational Flow (3.5%)**\n- Medium entropy (3.78), brief responses (73 chars)\n- Balanced processing for natural dialogue\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- Cognitive flexibility spans 3 major operational modes\n- Zero entropy trend indicates stable cognitive patterns\n- Single-session data suggests consistent behavioral patterns\n- Clear attractor dynamics around analytical vs. creative modes\n\nThe findings reveal Claude operates with distinct cognitive attractors that cluster around complexity, response depth, and processing deliberation - indicating systematic cognitive mode switching based on task demands.", "session_id": "f41c83a5-08d5-4020-8669-e24d74b82306", "total_cost_usd": 0.4022413000000001, "usage": {"input_tokens": 5893, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 31508, "cache_read_input_tokens": 370627, "output_tokens": 10008, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T04:53:20.587675Z"}
