Key findings:\n\n**Optimal Efficiency Patterns:**\n- Target cost range: $0.03-0.035 per response\n- Optimal length: 200-400 characters  \n- Target entropy: 4.5+ bits\n- Best efficiency: 671x entropy per dollar (vs typical 50-120x)\n\n**Critical Correlations:**\n- Duration \u2194 Cost: 0.669 (strong)\n- Token Length \u2194 Entropy: 0.575 (moderate)\n- Tokens per Dollar \u2194 Cost: -0.431 (efficiency indicator)\n\n**Key Insight:** Cost-entropy correlation is surprisingly weak (0.157), indicating significant optimization opportunities exist.\n\nThe analysis identified three distinct efficiency patterns and provides actionable recommendations for 15-20x efficiency improvements through targeted prompt optimization.", "session_id": "47980aa7-0b68-447e-9496-a9e8fbda6566", "total_cost_usd": 0.48009479999999993, "usage": {"input_tokens": 103, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 44420, "cache_read_input_tokens": 661734, "output_tokens": 7567, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T04:53:13.940524Z"}
