Now we have a solid knowledge management system in place. The key improvements:\n\n## What We've Built\n\n1. **Documented daemon quirks** in project CLAUDE.md:\n   - Socket communication formats\n   - AutonomousResearcher usage patterns  \n   - Common protocol issues\n   - Debugging approaches\n\n2. **Updated system workflow patterns** in main CLAUDE.md:\n   - When/then logic for daemon systems\n   - System engineering before experiments principle\n   - Knowledge capture requirements\n\n3. **Established patterns** for future development:\n   - Document first, experiment second\n   - Test protocols before complex features\n   - Immediate knowledge capture when discovering quirks\n\n## Next Steps Recommendation\n\nBefore continuing with autonomous experiments, we should:\n\n1. **Test the knowledge system**: Try a simple daemon modification to verify our documentation helps\n2. **Create validation scripts**: Simple tests to verify daemon protocols work as documented\n3. **Establish monitoring**: Better logging/debugging for autonomous agent spawning\n\nThe system is now designed to persist knowledge across sessions and help future Claude instances understand the daemon's quirks immediately. This should prevent rediscovering the same protocol issues repeatedly.", "session_id": "1639fd5a-1365-45a7-85c7-7bd2a432dbc8", "total_cost_usd": 0.24181945000000005, "usage": {"input_tokens": 42, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 31135, "cache_read_input_tokens": 300656, "output_tokens": 2046, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T04:49:35.033442Z"}
