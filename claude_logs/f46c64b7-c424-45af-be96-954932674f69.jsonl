Reads the comprehensive seed from `session_handoff.json`\n2. Pipes it as initial input to a new `chat.py` session  \n3. New Claude instance starts with full technical and meta-cognitive context\n\n## Session Continuity Complete\nYou now have end-to-end session continuity:\n- **Context monitoring** (65% usage detected)\n- **Automated essence extraction** (5-session chain processed)\n- **Enhanced handoff preparation** (technical + cognitive + meta-insights)\n- **New session spawning** with preserved context\n\nReady for autonomous multi-agent orchestration mode!", "session_id": "f46c64b7-c424-45af-be96-954932674f69", "total_cost_usd": 3.7550468, "usage": {"input_tokens": 98, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 26430, "cache_read_input_tokens": 248268, "output_tokens": 5136, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T14:15:21.544165Z"}
