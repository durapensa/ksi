This demonstrates good collaboration - it understood the workspace isolation system we implemented and applied it consistently to the remaining contaminating files.", "session_id": "14806e67-2121-491e-ac6e-dd959e0e07b4", "total_cost_usd": 0.3968385499999999, "usage": {"input_tokens": 34, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 71367, "cache_read_input_tokens": 353653, "output_tokens": 812, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T05:15:49.791562Z"}
