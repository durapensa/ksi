That's the root cause:\n\n**The Problem:**\n- `reader.read()` expects clients to send proper shutdown signals (EOF/SHUT_WR)\n- Many socket clients (including our autonomous researcher) don't send these signals\n- Daemon waits forever for EOF that never comes\n\n**Real-world scenario:**\n- Our `socat` commands worked because socat properly sends shutdown\n- Autonomous researcher's Python socket code didn't send proper shutdown\n- Result: daemon hangs waiting for a signal that's never coming\n\n**The fix was probably:**\n- Replace `reader.read()` with length-prefixed reads, or\n- Read until no more data available with timeout, or  \n- Use line-based protocol with `reader.readline()`, or\n- Handle the \"no shutdown signal\" case gracefully\n\nThis is a classic socket programming gotcha! Many clients just close the connection without the proper shutdown handshake, leaving servers hanging on `read()` calls.\n\n**Lesson:** Never assume clients will send proper EOF signals in socket communication. Always use protocols that don't rely on shutdown signals or handle the missing signal case.\n\nMuch more fundamental than SHUT_WR timing - it's about designing for \"imperfect\" client behavior in the real world.", "session_id": "86e2ddeb-3ad3-4854-b031-1f9403b04f44", "total_cost_usd": 0.03916589999999999, "usage": {"input_tokens": 10, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 256, "cache_read_input_tokens": 72127, "output_tokens": 475, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T02:44:39.773428Z"}
