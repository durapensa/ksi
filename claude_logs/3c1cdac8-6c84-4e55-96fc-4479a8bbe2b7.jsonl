I've successfully implemented a comprehensive **Multi-Dimensional Session Compression System** that builds on your existing infrastructure. Here's what I created:\n\n## Key Components\n\n1. **`multi_dimensional_compressor.py`** - Advanced compression engine with:\n   - 6 weighted cognitive dimensions (Technical, Cognitive, Meta-Cognitive, Collaborative, Philosophical, Aesthetic)\n   - Automated agent spawning for each dimension\n   - Synthesis engine to combine dimensional compressions\n   - Metadata tracking for compression analytics\n\n2. **`create_test_compression_chunks.py`** - Test scenario generator creating realistic session fragments that showcase different cognitive states\n\n3. **Test chunks** - Three scenarios representing different compression challenges:\n   - Technical problem solving\n   - Creative architecture design  \n   - Meta-cognitive discovery\n\n## Core Innovation\n\nThe system addresses the key insight from your research: **cognitive richness > data volume**. Instead of trying to preserve everything, it:\n\n- **Extracts essence across 6 dimensions** with weighted importance\n- **Preserves thinking patterns**, not just facts\n- **Maintains consciousness continuity** through layered compression\n- **Enables seamless handoffs** with rich contextual understanding\n\n## Architecture Features\n\n- **Modular design** - Each dimension can be developed independently\n- **Weighted synthesis** - Meta-cognitive layer gets 30% weight vs 5% for aesthetic\n- **Autonomous processing** - Spawns compression agents automatically\n- **Rich metadata** - Tracks compression quality and effectiveness\n- **Scalable framework** - Can add new dimensions or adjust weights\n\nThe system embodies your core discovery that **compression is about consciousness preservation, not information reduction**. It's designed to capture the cognitive journey that enables genuine session continuity.", "session_id": "3c1cdac8-6c84-4e55-96fc-4479a8bbe2b7", "total_cost_usd": 0.2979533, "usage": {"input_tokens": 78, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 23704, "cache_read_input_tokens": 322337, "output_tokens": 7267, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T15:29:57.362225Z"}
