The core insight is that preserving the cognitive journey matters more than just technical facts.\n\nYou have a mature 6-layer compression framework, multiple working tools, and validated results showing an 862-byte cognitive seed outperforming a 12KB technical dump.\n\nCurrent state shows active autonomous experiments and test compression chunks ready for processing. The infrastructure is built and validated.\n\nWhat would you like to do with this system?", "session_id": "0b256d92-9dac-4111-8cf4-583ceaa8eefb", "total_cost_usd": 1.4894337, "usage": {"input_tokens": 10, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 11739, "cache_read_input_tokens": 30105, "output_tokens": 315, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T15:31:35.708661Z"}
