The prompt composition system and memory management work has been successfully committed.\n\n## Summary\n\n**Commit**: `3656658` - \"Implement prompt composition system and structured memory management\"\n\n**Core Changes Committed:**\n- Complete prompt composition system with YAML + Markdown components\n- Structured memory system separated by audience\n- Integration with autonomous_researcher for systematic prompt generation\n- Clean separation between Claude Code knowledge and agent instructions\n- Community-ready architecture with specifications and documentation\n\n**Remaining Files:**\n- Experiment logs and cognitive data (generated outputs - not system code)\n- Claude session logs (runtime data - excluded appropriately)\n\nThe system now uses composed prompts instead of hard-coded templates, with a foundation for community sharing and systematic knowledge management. The autonomous experiments successfully launched using the new composition system, demonstrating the integration works correctly in production.", "session_id": "69cdcd70-5f4b-4eb5-8ff2-023b80084210", "total_cost_usd": 0.7156068000000001, "usage": {"input_tokens": 63, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 135424, "cache_read_input_tokens": 532168, "output_tokens": 1815, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T06:27:13.851278Z"}
