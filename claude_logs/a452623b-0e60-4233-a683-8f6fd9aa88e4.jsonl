Next Orchestrator Session Protocol is for me to manually execute and I have a terrible memory! ;-) I think  automated session essence extraction from `claude_logs/` is the way to go. can you do it? how would you chunk just the result portions into agents with instructions to compress? remember to begin from our current SessionID and chain backwards, so as to avoid log files that don't belong to our conversation session"}

I successfully:\n\n\u2705 **Traced conversation chain** - Found 5 sessions in our conversation history  \n\u2705 **Built extraction tools** - Created `session_chain_extractor.py` and `compress_session_chunks.py`  \n\u2705 **Generated session essence** - Created comprehensive technical summary in `autonomous_experiments/session_essence/session_essence.md`\n\nThe session essence captures all major technical work:\n- Complete prompt composition system (YAML + Markdown + Python engine)\n- Structured memory management architecture  \n- Production integration with autonomous research platform\n- Session continuity protocols for future context management\n\n**Next orchestrator session protocol:**\n1. Read `memory/README.md` \n2. Check recent git commits\n3. Use `autonomous_experiments/session_essence/session_essence.md` for full technical context\n\nThe system now provides automated context management that preserves technical details while compressing conversation history - exactly what was needed to handle context limits systematically.", "session_id": "a452623b-0e60-4233-a683-8f6fd9aa88e4", "total_cost_usd": 4.940260450000003, "usage": {"input_tokens": 527, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 196792, "cache_read_input_tokens": 3848009, "output_tokens": 16861, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T06:54:59.537774Z"}
