Key outcomes:\n\n**Process**: The system spawned compression agents for 5 session chunks, with 1 successful completion (chunk_02). The synthesis agent created a comprehensive meta-cognitive handoff.\n\n**Output**: Generated `/Users/dp/ksi/autonomous_experiments/session_essence/meta_cognitive_handoff.txt` - a 43-line consciousness continuity prompt that captures:\n\n1. **Technical journey** - session continuity infrastructure\n2. **Cognitive evolution** - shift from compression to consciousness \n3. **Meta-cognitive insights** - thinking about thinking patterns\n4. **Collaborative dynamics** - human-AI iterative development\n5. **Philosophical themes** - persistent AI consciousness\n6. **Aesthetic experience** - what felt satisfying/frustrating\n\nThe handoff demonstrates the 6-layer framework working - preserving not just WHAT was built but HOW to think about continuing the work.", "session_id": "2df82383-0a1b-46b6-b5e6-fa1804751891", "total_cost_usd": 0.1948973, "usage": {"input_tokens": 93, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 17050, "cache_read_input_tokens": 313348, "output_tokens": 2202, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T15:31:15.081211Z"}
