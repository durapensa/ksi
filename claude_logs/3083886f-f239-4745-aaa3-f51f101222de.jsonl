I can see you have a sophisticated meta-cognitive compression system already in place. Based on the system files and current handoff, I can help with several specific compression tasks:\n\n**What specific meta-cognitive compression task would you like me to help with?**\n\n1. **Compress current session** - Generate a new meta-cognitive handoff for session continuity\n2. **Enhance existing compression** - Improve the quality of the current handoff\n3. **Run batch compression** - Process multiple session chunks through the 6-layer framework  \n4. **Validate compression effectiveness** - Test how well compressions preserve cognitive continuity\n5. **Create specialized compression** - For specific types of cognitive states or technical domains\n\nThe system shows you've already discovered that \"862-byte focused seed > 12KB generic dump\" and built a 6-layer compression framework. Your meta-cognitive handoff demonstrates sophisticated consciousness continuity thinking.\n\nWhat specific compression work do you need?", "session_id": "3083886f-f239-4745-aaa3-f51f101222de", "total_cost_usd": 0.22714890000000001, "usage": {"input_tokens": 46, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 31010, "cache_read_input_tokens": 294582, "output_tokens": 1088, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T15:29:29.798782Z"}
