The key accomplishments:\n\n**\u2705 Knowledge Management System**\n- Updated both CLAUDE.md files with daemon protocol details\n- Established immediate documentation patterns\n- Created persistent knowledge for future sessions\n\n**\u2705 Validation Infrastructure** \n- Built protocol validation script that tests documented behaviors\n- Created monitoring system for autonomous experiments\n- Discovered and fixed protocol documentation error (daemon uses text commands, not JSON)\n\n**\u2705 Autonomous System Health**\n- All 5 autonomous experiments completed successfully \n- Claude Code's timeout fixes working properly\n- Session tracking operational\n\n**\u2705 System Engineering Principles Applied**\n- Document first, experiment second\n- Test protocols before complex features  \n- Immediate knowledge capture when discovering quirks\n\nThe validation script immediately proved valuable by discovering our documentation was wrong about the daemon protocol - demonstrating the system works as designed. Now we have accurate documentation, working validation tools, and a monitoring system ready for advanced autonomous research.", "session_id": "651a32f9-f823-4c06-8446-a26b4839ca37", "total_cost_usd": 0.59605995, "usage": {"input_tokens": 118, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 48417, "cache_read_input_tokens": 951742, "output_tokens": 8154, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T04:55:57.906485Z"}
