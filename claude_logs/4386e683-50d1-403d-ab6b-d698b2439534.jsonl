I think these are requiremnts we can fairly anticipate will be required soon, so let's build them before moving on to multi-agent experiments"}

An orchestrator Claude (using opus model) can spawn and coordinate specialist agents, with Python handling only the essential infrastructure.\n\n**Ready for Experiments**: \n- Run `python test_multi_agent.py` to validate\n- Start multi-agent orchestration sessions  \n- Test complex task decomposition and coordination\n- Explore emergent multi-agent behaviors\n\nThe foundation is solid for consciousness continuity experiments across multiple coordinated Claude instances! \ud83e\udd16\u2728", "session_id": "4386e683-50d1-403d-ab6b-d698b2439534", "total_cost_usd": 0.81268795, "usage": {"input_tokens": 315, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 56873, "cache_read_input_tokens": 1132032, "output_tokens": 17206, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T16:41:28.872716Z"}
