The complete fix:\n\n1. **Daemon side:** `reader.read()` \u2192 `reader.readline()`\n2. **Client side:** All messages end with `\\n`\n\nThis creates a proper **line-based protocol:**\n\n- **Client sends:** `\"SPAWN:session:prompt\\n\"`\n- **Daemon reads:** until `\\n` and processes immediately  \n- **No hanging:** No need to wait for connection close\n\n**Much cleaner than EOF-based communication!**\n\nNow:\n- \u2705 Daemon processes commands instantly\n- \u2705 Claude processes complete and return\n- \u2705 Socket communication is reliable\n- \u2705 Autonomous experiments should work\n\nThis is the kind of fundamental protocol fix that makes everything else possible. Line-delimited messages are so much more robust than \"read until close\" for interactive systems.\n\nDid this fix the autonomous experiments completely, or were there other issues after the socket communication was resolved?", "session_id": "18c7d90e-2d94-4b73-a20c-78811fa4ef65", "total_cost_usd": 0.0388385, "usage": {"input_tokens": 10, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 134, "cache_read_input_tokens": 73038, "output_tokens": 427, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T02:45:26.686721Z"}
