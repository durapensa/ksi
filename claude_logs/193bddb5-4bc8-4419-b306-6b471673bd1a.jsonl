I've successfully implemented **isolated agent workspaces** and documented the pattern for future memory:\n\n## What I Built\n\n**\u2705 Isolated Workspace System**\n- Each experiment gets its own workspace: `autonomous_experiments/workspaces/{experiment_name}/`\n- Updated all experiment templates to specify workspace usage\n- Agents instructed to create scripts in their workspace only\n\n**\u2705 Knowledge Persistence** \n- **Documented in CLAUDE.md**: Workspace patterns, agent instructions, benefits\n- **Clear pattern established**: Future Claude instances will know to keep agents isolated\n- **Cleanup reasoning**: Explained why isolation prevents system contamination\n\n**\u2705 Legacy Cleanup**\n- Moved contaminating agent scripts to `legacy_scripts/` with documentation\n- Root directory clean of agent-generated files\n- Clear example of why workspace isolation is necessary\n\n## Memory System Working\n\nThe pattern is now **permanently documented** in CLAUDE.md:\n\n1. **Agent Instructions Pattern**: Always include workspace directives in prompts\n2. **File Organization**: Scripts isolated, outputs in parent directory  \n3. **Benefits Documented**: No contamination, parallel execution, easy cleanup\n4. **Critical Principle**: \"Keep agents in isolated workspaces to prevent system contamination\"\n\nThis knowledge will persist across sessions - future Claude instances will automatically know to:\n- Create isolated workspaces for autonomous agents\n- Include workspace directives in experiment prompts  \n- Keep agent scripts separate from ksi system files\n- Follow the established organizational patterns\n\nThe system now prevents the script intermingling problem you identified, with the solution permanently captured in our knowledge base.", "session_id": "193bddb5-4bc8-4419-b306-6b471673bd1a", "total_cost_usd": 0.47198965, "usage": {"input_tokens": 118, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 8465, "cache_read_input_tokens": 1189753, "output_tokens": 4834, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T05:06:30.882960Z"}
