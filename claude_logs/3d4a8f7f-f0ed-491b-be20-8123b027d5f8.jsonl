Here are some options based on your project:\n\n1. **Run the direct meta-compression tool** - Execute the existing compression pipeline on your session chunks\n2. **Analyze/improve compression effectiveness** - Review the compression outputs and optimize the approach\n3. **Create new compression experiments** - Design new tests for the meta-cognitive framework\n4. **Implement compression quality metrics** - Build tools to measure compression effectiveness\n5. **Synthesize existing results** - Create a unified analysis from your extensive data\n\nWhat would you like to focus on?", "session_id": "3d4a8f7f-f0ed-491b-be20-8123b027d5f8", "total_cost_usd": 0.13806385000000002, "usage": {"input_tokens": 17, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 28709, "cache_read_input_tokens": 62765, "output_tokens": 405, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T15:27:03.207186Z"}
