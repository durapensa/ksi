I guess you could say its part of the interactive session management. I was hoping for a way to use the interactive Claude Code's compact. perhaps there's an answer on the web (careful of your own context filling doing this) or we need to figure out our own quicksmart (although our conversationshould all be backed up in claude_logs, just no elegant way to pass it on to a new Orchestrator Claude fresh new session (pass it on compacted, that is)"}

Read `memory/README.md` first\n2. Check `git log --oneline -10` for recent work\n3. Read `memory/workflow_patterns/session_continuity.md` for session essence\n4. Continue from documented current state\n\n### Future Enhancement Opportunity\nWe could build automated session essence extraction from `claude_logs/` - the conversation data is there, we'd just need a tool to analyze and compress it into structured handoff summaries.\n\nThe memory system we built solves exactly this problem - systematic knowledge capture that persists across session boundaries. Combined with Claude Code's `/compact`, we have both immediate and long-term solutions for context management.", "session_id": "63601230-f613-49c5-add7-0cbade3e37f1", "total_cost_usd": 1.2293364500000001, "usage": {"input_tokens": 93, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 131632, "cache_read_input_tokens": 988395, "output_tokens": 2978, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T06:36:14.549753Z"}
