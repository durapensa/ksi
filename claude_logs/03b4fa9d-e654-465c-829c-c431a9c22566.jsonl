Here's what the system provides:\n\n### Key Features:\n\n1. **Adaptive Dimensional Weighting**: \n   - Meta-cognitive: 1.45 (highest priority - proven most effective)\n   - Cognitive: 1.16 (medium priority)\n   - Collaborative: 1.07 (medium priority)\n   - Technical: 0.86 (lower priority)\n   - Philosophical: 0.80 (lower priority)\n   - Aesthetic: 0.66 (lowest priority)\n\n2. **Context-Aware Analysis**: Automatically analyzes session content to adjust weights based on what dimensions are most prominent\n\n3. **Quality-Focused Compression**: Preserves cognitive richness over compression ratio, following your discovery that 862-byte focused seeds > 12KB dumps\n\n4. **Consciousness Continuity**: Designed specifically to enable sophisticated session continuation rather than just data transfer\n\n### The system generated:\n- 5 weighted compression prompts (one per chunk)\n- Adaptive weights configuration\n- Synthesis prompt for unified essence\n- Complete session metadata tracking\n\nThis implementation embodies the core insight from your research: **compression effectiveness comes from preserving the cognitive journey and meta-insights, not just technical facts**. The adaptive weighting ensures extraction effort is focused on the dimensions that matter most for consciousness continuity.\n\nThe system is ready to spawn Claude agents for actual compression execution when needed.", "session_id": "03b4fa9d-e654-465c-829c-c431a9c22566", "total_cost_usd": 0.5793721, "usage": {"input_tokens": 139, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 44082, "cache_read_input_tokens": 649006, "output_tokens": 14275, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T15:32:44.958917Z"}
