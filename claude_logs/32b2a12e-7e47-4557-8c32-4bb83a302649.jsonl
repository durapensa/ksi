Clean context is definitely better for autonomous agents.\n\n**Key observation:** No autonomous experiment log files found in `claude_logs/` - which means they're not even creating session logs, let alone output files.\n\n**This suggests:** The autonomous agents might be getting responses but **not actually executing their tasks** (reading files, writing analysis).\n\nWhat did Claude Code find when looking into this? Are the autonomous agents:\n\n1. **Getting permission errors** when trying to use Read/Write tools?\n2. **Succeeding but writing to wrong directory**?\n3. **Failing silently** without error messages?\n4. **Not receiving the expected tool permissions** despite the allowedTools fix?\n\n**Simple test idea:** Should we spawn a single autonomous Claude with a basic task like:\n```\necho \"SPAWN:debug_test:Write the text 'Hello World' to the file autonomous_experiments/test.txt using the Write tool\" | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:sockets/claude_daemon.sock\n```\n\nThis would immediately tell us if autonomous agents can write files at all.\n\nWhat is Claude Code finding about the autonomous experiment behavior?", "session_id": "32b2a12e-7e47-4557-8c32-4bb83a302649", "total_cost_usd": 0.36965970000000004, "usage": {"input_tokens": 24, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 87550, "cache_read_input_tokens": 85672, "output_tokens": 708, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T04:18:00.062377Z"}
