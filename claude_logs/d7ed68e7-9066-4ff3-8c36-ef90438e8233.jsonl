Let me break down alternatives for the local metadata layer:\n\n## DuckDB\n**Pros:** \n- Analytical powerhouse (OLAP vs SQLite's OLTP focus)\n- Blazing fast aggregations on experiment data\n- Can directly query JSON/Parquet files\n- Great for time-series analysis of costs/performance\n\n**Cons:**\n- Larger binary size\n- Overkill for simple key-value lookups\n\n```sql\n-- DuckDB excels at this type of analysis\nSELECT date_trunc('day', created_at) as day,\n       percentile_cont(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY cost) as p95_cost\nFROM experiments \nWHERE created_at > now() - interval '30 days'\nGROUP BY day;\n```\n\n## Redis\n**Pros:**\n- Lightning fast lookups\n- Built-in data structures (sets, sorted sets, hashes)\n- Perfect for caching prompt effectiveness scores\n- Pub/sub for real-time experiment notifications\n\n**Cons:**\n- Memory-only (unless configured otherwise)\n- Less structured querying\n\n```bash\n# Great for quick lookups\nredis-cli HGET \"prompt:abc123\" \"avg_cost\"\nredis-cli ZADD \"prompts_by_cost\" 0.15 \"prompt:abc123\"\n```\n\n## Plain JSON + ripgrep/jq\n**Pros:**\n- Zero dependencies beyond standard tools\n- Incredibly fast text search with `rg`\n- Easy to inspect/debug\n- Works with your existing tools (`fx`, `jless`)\n\n**Cons:**\n- No indexing for complex queries\n- Aggregations get clunky\n\n```bash\n# Surprisingly powerful for many use cases\nrg '\"success_rate\": [0-9]\\.[89]' experiments/ | jq '.cost' | sort -n\n```\n\n## LMDB (Lightning Memory-Mapped Database)\n**Pros:**\n- Ultra-fast key-value store\n- Memory-mapped for speed\n- ACID transactions\n- Tiny footprint\n\n**Cons:**\n- Limited query capabilities\n- More complex than SQLite for relational data\n\n## My Take\n\nFor Claude experiment tracking, I'd lean toward:\n\n1. **SQLite** - Still the sweet spot for most use cases\n2. **DuckDB** - If you're doing heavy analytics on experiment trends\n3. **JSON + tools** - If you want to stay in the Unix philosophy\n\n**The hybrid-hybrid approach:** Start with JSON files (dead simple), graduate to SQLite when you need complex queries, then DuckDB if you're doing serious data science on your experiments.\n\nWhat kind of analysis are you planning?
