Even with explicit `--allowedTools`, the spawned Claude requests permissions.\n\n**Solution for Claude Code:** The `--allowedTools` argument needs debugging. The spawned instances should have Read/Write access automatically but they're still asking for permissions.\n\n**Summary for stability:**\n- \u2705 Socket communication fixed (SHUT_WR issue resolved)\n- \u2705 Session resumption working perfectly  \n- \u2705 Core chat infrastructure stable\n- \u274c Autonomous experiments blocked by tool permissions\n- \u2705 Cognitive observer capturing data from our conversation\n\n**Current session:** `8a15bfb8-f9c3-4d26-876a-1c3a03438706`\n\nThe system is now stable for regular chat but needs one more fix for autonomous mode. Claude Code should investigate why `--allowedTools` isn't granting tools properly to spawned instances.\n\nWant to call it good for tonight and tackle autonomous experiments when fresh?", "session_id": "d1153ff8-03eb-44f1-8b2c-7b1e2fb18eaf", "total_cost_usd": 0.36915984999999996, "usage": {"input_tokens": 66, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 62957, "cache_read_input_tokens": 294659, "output_tokens": 1875, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T02:44:01.493431Z"}
