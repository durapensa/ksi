I found Python DSL to be the most intelligible but I'm unsure if that 's what best for your use. perhaps we want something git friendly and that is also shareable to a git community like the prompt fragments themselves? sharing a composition system is potentially much more impactful than just sharing prompts, because many many places online share prompts with no good organization or standardization or composition system, etc."}

We have an opportunity to create something the community desperately needs.\n\n## The Bigger Picture\n\n**Current state**: Prompt sharing is a mess\n- Scattered across forums, gists, repos\n- No organization or composition standards  \n- Copy-paste culture with no modularity\n- No way to build on others' work systematically\n\n**Our opportunity**: Create a **standardized prompt composition system**\n- Git-friendly format that shows clean diffs\n- Shareable, modular components\n- Clear composition rules that others can adopt\n- Could become a community standard\n\n## Git Community-Friendly Design\n\n### YAML Compositions + Markdown Components\n```yaml\n# prompts/compositions/autonomous_researcher.yaml\nname: \"autonomous_researcher\"\nversion: \"1.0\"\ndescription: \"Self-directed research agent with workspace isolation\"\nauthor: \"ksi-project\"\n\ncomponents:\n  - name: \"system_identity\"\n    source: \"components/system_identity.md\"\n    vars:\n      role: \"autonomous research agent\"\n      \n  - name: \"workspace_isolation\" \n    source: \"components/workspace_isolation.md\"\n    vars:\n      workspace: \"autonomous_experiments/workspaces/{{experiment_name}}\"\n      \n  - name: \"analysis_framework\"\n    source: \"components/analysis_framework.md\"\n    condition: \"{{analysis_type}} in ['entropy', 'concept', 'attractor']\"\n\nrequired_context:\n  - experiment_name: \"string\"\n  - output_path: \"string\" \n  - analysis_type: \"enum[entropy,concept,attractor,efficiency,meta]\"\n\nmetadata:\n  tags: [\"research\", \"autonomous\", \"isolation\"]\n  use_cases: [\"cognitive_analysis\", \"data_exploration\"]\n  tested_with: [\"claude-sonnet\", \"claude-opus\"]\n```\n\n## Community Impact Potential\n\n**What we'd be sharing:**\n1. **Composition format** - Standard way to define prompt recipes\n2. **Component library** - Reusable prompt fragments  \n3. **Composition engine** - Code to execute compositions\n4. **Best practices** - Patterns for prompt organization\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- **Modularity**: Build complex prompts from tested components\n- **Version control**: Track prompt evolution properly in git\n- **Collaboration**: Multiple people can contribute components\n- **Quality**: Tested, documented prompt patterns\n- **Discoverability**: Organized library vs scattered files\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Build for ksi (Proof of Concept)\n- YAML compositions + Markdown components\n- Simple composition engine\n- Integration with our daemon system\n\n### Phase 2: Generalize and Document  \n- Clean up for community sharing\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Examples and tutorials\n- GitHub repo with clear contribution guidelines\n\n### Phase 3: Community Adoption\n- Share as open source project\n- Write about it (blog posts, documentation)\n- Provide migration tools for existing prompt collections\n\n## The Composition Standard\n\nIf done right, this could become **the way** people organize prompts:\n- **Organizations** could have shared prompt libraries\n- **Open source projects** could include `.prompt/` directories\n- **AI tool builders** could adopt the composition format\n- **Researchers** could share reproducible prompt recipes\n\nShould I start with the **YAML + Markdown** approach, designing it from the beginning to be community-shareable?
