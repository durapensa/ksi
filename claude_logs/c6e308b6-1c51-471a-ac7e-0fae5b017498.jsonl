Here's what I found:\n\n## Aesthetic Compression in Practice\n\nThe system captures aesthetic dimensions through:\n\n**Key Elements:**\n- **Satisfying moments**: Elegant design solutions, coherent architectures\n- **Frustrating experiences**: Technical blockers, generic responses  \n- **Breakthrough insights**: Paradigm shifts like \"consciousness continuity\" over \"state transfer\"\n\n**Specific Example:**\nThe system discovered that a focused 862-byte compression outperformed a 12KB data dump - capturing this \"size paradox resolution\" as an aesthetic breakthrough moment.\n\n**Data Structure:**\n```json\n\"aesthetic_notes\": {\n  \"satisfying\": \"6-layer model elegance\",\n  \"frustrating\": \"Generic handoff responses\", \n  \"breakthrough\": \"Shift from state to consciousness\"\n}\n```\n\n**Integration Value:**\n- Correlates with solution quality\n- Marks genuine cognitive shifts\n- Preserves the \"feel\" of work for session continuity\n- Captures emotional journey, not just technical progress\n\nThe aesthetic dimension, despite lowest priority (0.66 weight), provides crucial qualitative information about the problem-solving experience - what felt right, what caused frustration, and moments of genuine insight.", "session_id": "c6e308b6-1c51-471a-ac7e-0fae5b017498", "total_cost_usd": 1.4023218499999996, "usage": {"input_tokens": 74, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 18756, "cache_read_input_tokens": 256661, "output_tokens": 1673, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T16:00:25.692378Z"}
