Your session seed demonstrates excellent compression quality - preserving technical details, architectural insights, and cognitive patterns.\n\nWhat specific meta-cognitive compression task would you like me to work on? I see several possibilities:\n\n1. **Compress the current session** using your 6-layer framework\n2. **Analyze compression quality** of existing compressed sessions\n3. **Enhance the compression system** with new features\n4. **Create a new compression** from recent cognitive data\n\nLet me know which direction you'd like to explore.", "session_id": "2ebff8b6-abd5-452b-90df-7dfd11c60c6d", "total_cost_usd": 0.08790825000000001, "usage": {"input_tokens": 21, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 14869, "cache_read_input_tokens": 69057, "output_tokens": 445, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T15:28:07.618081Z"}
