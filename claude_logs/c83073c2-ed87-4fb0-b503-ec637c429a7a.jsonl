The socket communication went from \"mysterious hanging\" to \"observable, reliable messaging.\"\n\nGreat engineering - you fixed the protocol, the implementation, AND the observability all at once.", "session_id": "c83073c2-ed87-4fb0-b503-ec637c429a7a", "total_cost_usd": 0.03834285, "usage": {"input_tokens": 10, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 231, "cache_read_input_tokens": 73172, "output_tokens": 373, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T02:45:39.128668Z"}
