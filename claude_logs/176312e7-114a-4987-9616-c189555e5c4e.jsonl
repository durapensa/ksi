I got carried away with the \"prompts as code\" metaphor, but let me think through this properly:\n\n## Git Pros/Cons\n\n**Git Pros:**\n- Natural branching for A/B testing prompts\n- Built-in diff to see exactly what changed between versions\n- Tagging successful experiments (`git tag \"analyzer-v3-cost-optimized\"`)\n- Distributed - sync experiments across machines\n- Rich ecosystem (GitHub, blame, bisect for finding when prompts broke)\n\n**Git Cons:**\n- Terrible for queries like \"find all prompts with cost < $0.10 and success > 80%\"\n- No indexing for fast search\n- Binary experiment results don't diff well\n- Gets bloated with large datasets\n- Overkill for simple version tracking\n\n## SQLite Advantages\n\nSQLite is probably better for a knowledge system because:\n\n```sql\n-- This is impossible with git but trivial with SQLite:\nSELECT prompt_text, avg(cost), avg(success_rate) \nFROM experiments \nWHERE task_type = 'analysis' \n  AND created_date > '2024-06-01'\nGROUP BY prompt_hash\nORDER BY avg(success_rate) DESC, avg(cost) ASC\n```\n\n## Other Contenders\n\n**Hybrid Git + SQLite**: Prompts in git, metadata in SQLite\n**ripgrep + JSON**: Dead simple, blazing fast text search\n**Document DB**: MongoDB/CouchDB for schema flexibility  \n**Time-series DB**: InfluxDB for experiment metrics over time\n\n## The Real Question\n\nWhat queries do you actually need? If it's mostly:\n- \"Find similar successful prompts\"  \n- \"What works best for X task type?\"\n- \"Cost/performance trends over time\"\n\nThen SQLite wins hands down. Git shines for collaborative prompt development and seeing evolution over time.\n\nWhat kinds of searches/analysis were you doing with SQLite? That would help me understand the real requirements better.", "session_id": "176312e7-114a-4987-9616-c189555e5c4e", "total_cost_usd": 0.025363950000000003, "usage": {"input_tokens": 10, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 723, "cache_read_input_tokens": 25665, "output_tokens": 892, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-19T23:56:11.420285Z"}
