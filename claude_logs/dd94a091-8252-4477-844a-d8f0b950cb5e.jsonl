Here are the key findings:\n\n**Graph Statistics:**\n- **244 concepts** with **227 relationships**\n- **42 connected components** with largest component of 153 nodes\n- **Low density (0.008)** indicating a sparse but structured network\n\n**Top Cognitive Hubs:**\n1. **\"this\"** - Primary hub with highest centrality (score: 0.594)\n2. **\"working\"** - Key operational concept (score: 0.433) \n3. **\"they\"** - Important relational bridge (score: 0.426)\n4. **\"experiments\"** - Central to research activity (score: 0.384)\n5. **\"actually\"** - Emphasis/clarification hub (score: 0.306)\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- **\"this\"** acts as the primary cognitive hub, connecting diverse concepts\n- **\"working\"** and **\"experiments\"** form operational clusters around activity\n- **\"they\"** serves as a critical bridge between concepts (highest betweenness centrality)\n- Strong concept pairs include \"actually \u2194 this\" and \"observatory \u2194 working\"\n\nResults saved to `autonomous_experiments/concept_graph.json` with complete centrality metrics and graph analysis.", "session_id": "dd94a091-8252-4477-844a-d8f0b950cb5e", "total_cost_usd": 0.41881415000000016, "usage": {"input_tokens": 109, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 30157, "cache_read_input_tokens": 504016, "output_tokens": 9908, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0}}, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T04:48:11.482118Z"}
