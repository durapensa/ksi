# Context Compact: Composition-Based Multi-Agent System

## Session Summary
Implemented a composition-based prompt system to replace hard-coded prompts and conversation types in the KSI multi-agent infrastructure.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Dynamic Daemon Commands
- Added `GET_COMMANDS` handler to daemon's command_handler.py
- Returns all available commands with formats and descriptions
- Enables agents to discover daemon capabilities dynamically

### 2. Prompt Composer Integration  
- Modified agent_process.py to use PromptComposer for all prompt generation
- Agents load compositions from profile configuration
- Fallback to legacy prompts if composition not found
- Context includes: agent_id, role, conversation_history, daemon_commands

### 3. Response Control System
- Created conversation_control/response_rules.md component
- Implemented control signals: [END], [NO_RESPONSE], [TERMINATE]
- Added signal detection and filtering in agent_process.py
- Agents can terminate gracefully using [END] signal

### 4. Conversation Patterns
- Created role-specific components (initiator/responder patterns)
- Built compositions: claude_agent_default, conversation_hello_goodbye, simple_hello_goodbye
- Agent profiles updated to use "composition" field instead of "system_prompt"

### 5. Test Infrastructure
- Moved all test scripts to tests/ directory
- Updated virtual environment instructions in CLAUDE.md
- Created test_composition_system.py to verify integration

## Current Issues

1. **Pattern Adherence**: Agents compose prompts correctly but don't follow hello/goodbye instructions consistently
2. **Response Hanging**: Some agents hang after composing prompts, may be SPAWN command issue
3. **Variable Substitution**: Template variables may not substitute correctly in all cases

## Next Steps

1. Debug why agents aren't following composed instructions
2. Remove ConversationMode class from orchestrate.py
3. Add better error handling for missing compositions
4. Create integration tests for pattern following
5. Document the architecture comprehensively

## Architecture Benefits

- No more hard-coded prompts or conversation types
- Extensible through modular components
- Dynamic command discovery
- Graceful conversation termination
- Git-friendly prompt management

The foundation is complete for a fully composition-driven system where all agent behaviors are defined through reusable components.
